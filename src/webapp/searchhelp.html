<h2 align="center">Search Help</h2>

The search system for "Darwin Online" consists of two parts. The first part,
"free text search", which searches for words appearing in the digital text
of the items on the site, is very similar to that operated by general Web
search engines such as Google or Yahoo.
<div>
<br/>
<label for="free-text">Free Text:</label> 
<input
  name="freetext" type="text"></input> (Free text search within the body of the texts) <br />
</div>
  
<p/>Into this input box on the Search pages, or in the "Search" box at the head
of each page on the website, you may type a set of words you wish to locate
within the digital texts. By default these will be found as isolated words - if
you wish to find a connected phrase, surround the phrase in inverted commas,
like so - "origin of species".

<p/>The second part of the search system, which appears only on the search pages
themselves, relates the bibliographic records and metadata held about the
items on the site to the digital texts themselves. 
<div>
<br/>
<label for="dateafter">After date:</label>
<input name="dateafter" style="width: 100px"></input>
Date in format YYYY-MM-DD - e.g. 1859-11-24 (MM, DD optional)<br />
</div>

<p/>For example, entering a date into this box will restrict the returned items
to those dated after the entered date (considered inclusively). You may type
either simply a four-digit year, a year followed by a month, or a precise
date. 

<p/>In combination with the "Before date:" field, for example, you may restrict the
returned results to only those from a single year, say 1859, by typing the same
year into both "After date:" and "Before date:".

<p/>The other fields and controls on the search pages work similarly - in general
they are all "restrictive" in that they will narrow down the returned set of
results, for example to those in a particular language or of a particular type.

<p/>Note that although you may use the free text, and field-based search controls
alternatively, or simultaneously, whether any text is typed into the "free text" 
field determines the fundamental nature of the search, that is, the type of hit that will be 
returned. If you enter free text keywords, the hits returned will be to specific
<strong>pages</strong> in the digital text, whereas if you do not, the hits will 
consist of <strong>bibliographic records</strong> representing items as a whole, from which further 
links will lead you to the digital text and facsimile if these are stored on the
site.

<p/>Note that there are currently many more items (around 34,000) held in the bibliographic
databases than those for which digital text or images are held (currently around 500).
