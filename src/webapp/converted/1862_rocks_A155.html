  <p align="center"><em>Nos.</em> 1 <em>to</em> 105, <em>from the Island of Ascension, were collected by Mr. Charles Darwin, F.R.S., and Captain Ord, R.E.</em></p>
  <p>The Island of Ascension, situated between the coasts of Africa and Brazil, is nine miles long by six in breadth. Its entire surface, which is broken into mountains, hills, and ravines, is covered with ashes, cinders, pumice, and lava. Its general appearance is that of a mass of smooth, bright-red conical hills, with truncated summits, rising from a plain of black, sterile lava. The highest point on the island, Green Hill, is 2,870 feet above the sea-level.</p>
  <p>Nos. 1 to 14e, are varieties of Lava, of which 4 to 8 and 10 are more or less cellular, while 9, 11, and 13 are more compact.</p>
  <p>Nos. 14 to 14e, as well as No. 106, from Chatham Island, Galapagos Archipelago, from the superficial parts of a lava-stream, are especially remarkable for their singular forms. They are described as being scattered over the surface of the ground, presenting the appearance of logs and branches of trees.</p>
  <p>Nos. 15 to 26 represent varieties of laminated beds, which alternate with and pass into Obsidian.</p>
  <p>The great number of these are composed of Pearlstone and Pitchstone, with occasional nodules of Obsidian, alternating with felspathic layers.</p>
  <p>Nos. 18, 22, and 23 are sph&aelig;rulitic, while 16, 19 to 21, 24 and 25 contain included crystals of glassy felspar, lying lengthways, or with their longest axes parallel with the lamin&aelig; in which they are included; an arrangement which is due to the motion of the mass while in a heated state.</p>
  <p>Nos. 27 to 31 show the passage from Pitchstone into Obsidian.</p>
  <p>It may be observed that Pitchstone and Obsidian are merely different forms of the same substance, caused by the unequal rate at which the liquified mass of melted rock has been cooled. Obsidian (or the more perfect form of volcanic glass) is from the superficial portion of the mass which has cooled most rapidly, while the more dull, opaque interior portion into which true Obsidian passes at a slight depth, and which has cooled more slowly, is termed Pitchstone. See page 244.</p>
  <p class="style2">* See also No. 275, Case 6, p. 259.</p>
  <p dar:class="page">[page] 221</p>
  <p>Nos. 31 to 31c are varieties of volcanic slag, exhibiting different degrees of fusion.</p>
  <p>Nos. 32 to 62 are from the series of trachytic rocks which form the more elevated and central, and likewise the south-east part of the island. Nos.  57 to 58 are augitic lavas, with included crystals of glassy felspar.</p>
  <p>Nos. 63 and 64 are pumiceous. 65 to 67 volcanic ashes and sand, or the more finely divided products of eruption.</p>
  <p>No. 68 to 73 are varieties of softer, Tufa and 105 are concretions which occasionally occur in it.</p>
  <p>Nos. 85 to 92 are volcanic bombs and fragments of rocks which have been shot forth during a&euml;riform explosions, and are now found mixed with masses of scori&aelig;. Nos. 86 to 88 exhibit striking proofs of their having been in a fluid state, and of having had a rotatory motion communicated to them when originally vomited from the crater. This is especially to be observed in 86.</p>
  <p>Siliceous sinter is represented by Nos. 95 to 99. It occurs in the altered Trachytes either in the form of irregular masses or in seams. The formation of these, as well as of the thin plate-like veins No.  93, has been produced by the segregation or infiltration of siliceous matter.</p>
  <p>In the same manner the Jasper, (Nos. 100 to 102,) which also forms large irregular masses in the altered Trachyte, was probably produced by a process (as suggested by Mr. Darwin) analogous to that by which wood becomes gradually silicified; that is, by the gradual removal, particle by particle, of the original rock, (in this case a basaltic rock,) accompanied by the simultaneous substitution of siliceous matter and iron.</p>
  <p>Nos. 106 to 109 are varieties of scoriaceous Lava from Chatham Island, Galapagos Archipelago; while 110 to 113 are cellular basaltic Lavas, the latter containing crystals of Olivine.</p>
  <p>Nos. 116 to 117 are from the Cape de Verde Islands.</p>
  <p>Various kinds of Lava from New Zealand (White Island) are represented by Nos. 121 to 126. 127 and 128 are specimens of siliceous sinter. 129 and 130, gypsum; 131 and 132, native sulphur; and 133, the ashes with which the country around Auckland is covered.</p>
  <p>Nos.134 and 135 are from volcanic springs at Kertch, in the Crimea.</p>

  <p>31. OBSIDIAN, passing into vesicular, scoriaceous Lava, and presenting an appearance of perfect fusion.</p>
  <p>31a. VOLCANIC SLAG, SCORIA, or CINDER, presenting an appearance of partial fusion, and converted in some places, into layers of Obsidian.</p>

  <p align="center"><strong>VOLCANIC BOMBS.</strong></p>
  <p>85. VOLCANIC BOMB OF OBSIDIAN.</p>
  <p>&quot;The specimen was found, in present state, on a great sandy plain between  the rivers Darling and Murray, in Australia, and at the distance of several hundred miles from any known volcanic region. The external saucer consists of compact obsidian, of a bottle-green colour, and is filled with finely cellular lava, much less transparent and glassy than the obsidian. The external surface is marked with four or five not quite perfect ridges. The lip of the saucer is slightly concave, exactly like the margin of a soup-plate, and its inner edge overlaps a little the central cellular lava. This structure is so symmetrical round the entire circumference, that one is force to suppose that the bomb burst during its rotatory course before becoming quite solidified, and that the lip and edges were thus slightly modified and turned inwards.&quot; (See Darwin &quot;On Volcanic Islands,&quot; pp. 38 and 39.)</p>
  <p>86. Fragment of a spherical VOLCANIC BOMB, with the interior parts coarsely cellular, coated with a concentric layer of compact Lava, and this again with a crust of finely-cellular rock, forming the external surface.</p>
  <p>&quot;This structure may be explained, by supposing a mass of viscid scoriaceous matter to be projected with a rapid rotatory motion through the air; for whilst the external crust from cooling became solidified, the centrifugal force, by relieving the pressure in the interior parts of the bomb, would allow the heated vapours to expand their cells; but these being driven by the same force against the already hardened crust would become, the nearer they were to this part, smaller and smaller or less expanded until they became packed into a hard solid concentric shell.&quot; (See Darwin &quot;On Volcanic Islands,&quot; pp. 36 and 37.)</p>
  <p>87. Part of a VOLCANIC BOMB of a similar description to No. 86, and showing the internal structure.</p>
  <p>88. Portion of a VOLCANIC BOMB, composed of coarse and finer cellular rock, of an irregularly</p>
  <p dar:class="page">[page] 226</p>
  <p>scoriaceous structure; probably the central portion of the bomb.</p>
  <p>89. EJECTED GRANITIC FRAGMENT, consisting of a brick-red mass of felspar, quartz, and small dark patches of a fused mineral, ascertained by its cleaveage to be hornblende.</p>
  <p>(See Darwin &quot;On Volcanic Islands,&quot; p. 40.)</p>
  <p>90. EJECTED GRANITIC FRAGMENT (<em>Syenite</em>), streaked and mottled with red, and composed of white <em>potash-felspar,</em> numerous grains of <em>quartz,</em> and small crystals of <em>hornblende.</em></p>
  <p>91. EJECTED FRAGMENT (<em>white granitic rock</em>), composed of confusedly crystallized white <em>felspar,</em> with little nests of a dark-coloured mineral, often carious, externally rounded, and with no distinct cleavage, probably <em>fused hornblende.</em> This rock was ejected amongst cinders from one of the more recent volcanos.</p>
  <p>(See Darwin &quot;On Volcanic Islands,&quot; p. 41.)</p>
  <p>92. EJECTED FRAGMENT, <em>Greenstone,</em> composed of crystals of <em>Labrador Felspar,</em> a little <em>altered hornblende,</em> and scales of black <em>mica,</em> with white granular <em>felspar,</em> filling the interstices.</p>
  <p>(See Darwin &quot;On volcanic Islands,&quot; p. 41.)</p>
  <p>93. EJECTED FRAGMENT, portions of hard SILICEOUS PLATE-LIKE VEINS, of varying thickness, intersecting the earthy trachytic masses on the flanks of the &quot;crater of the old volcano.&quot;</p>
  <p>(See Darwin &quot;On Volcanic Islands,&quot; pp. 44 and 45.)</p>
  <p>94. Seams of compact OXIDE OF IRON, occuring conformably in the lower parts of a stratified mass of ashes and fragments.</p>
  <p>&quot;This seam of compact stone, by intercepting the little rainwater which falls on the island, gives riseto a small dripping spring, first discovered by Dampier. It is the only fresh water on the island, so that the possibility of its being inhabited has entirely depended on the occurrence of this ferruginous layer.&quot; (See Darwin &quot;On Volcanic Islands,&quot; p. 39.)</p>
  <p>95. WHITE SILICEOUS SINTER, occuring in altered Trachyte.</p>
  <p>(See Darwin &quot;On Volcanic Islands,&quot; p. 45.)</p>
  <p>96. SEAMS OF SILICEOUS SINTER, occurring in altered Trachyte.</p>
  <p>97. WHITE SILICEOUS SINTER.</p>
  <p>98. Cream-coloured SILICEOUS SINTER.</p>
  <p>99. SILICEOUS SINTER, formed of thin irregular plates of <em>chalcedonic quartz,</em> occuring in altered Trachyte.</p>
  <p>100. Ochreous-brown coloured <em>jasper,</em> occurring in large irregular masses, and sometimes in veins, both in altered Trachyte, and in an associated mass of scoriaceous Basalt.</p>
  <p>(See Darwin &quot;On Volcanic islands,&quot; p. 46.)</p>

  <p>103. SILICEOUS CONGLOMERATE, with small prismatic crystals of <em>tourmaline</em> and crystals of <em>quartz,</em> and coated with a thin layer of <em>siliceous sinter.</em></p>
  <p>104. ROCK RESEMBLING SYENITIC GNEISS, probably from one of the laminated beds alternating with and passing into Obsidian, noticed in Darwin &quot;On Volcanic Islands,&quot; pp. 56 and 57.</p>

  <p align="center"><em>Volcanic Specimens from the Galapagos Archipelago, Chatham Island.</em></p>
  <p align="center">(Collected and presented by CHARLES DARWIN, F.R.S.)</p>
  <p>The Galapagos Archipelago consists of ten islands, situated under the equator, 500 or 600 miles westward of the coast of America. They are all formed of volcanic rocks, and are chiefly remarkable for the immense number of craters with which they are covered. These are formed either of lava and scori&aelig;, or of tufa; in the latter case they present beautifully symmetrical forms, which appears to be owing to their having been formed while standing out at sea, by the eruptions of volcanic mud, without any lava.</p>
  <p>Chatham Island is the largest of three islands, intersected by the Parallel of 43&deg; 45&prime;&prime; S., and by the meridian of 176&deg; 40&prime; W. It contains 477 square miles. The rocks are chiefly volcanic, and the island itself presents a rugged, arid appearance; the dark basaltic lava, of which the surface is composed, being covered by a dwarfed and parched brushwood.&mdash;H. W. BRISTOW.</p>

  <p align="center">Presented by the Lords of the Admiralty.</p>
  <p>White Island, or Puhia-i-Wakari, is situated in the Bay of Plenty, in the south-cast district of New Zealand. It is six miles in circumference. It contains an active volcano, and yields considerable quantities of sulphur. The flames issuing from its crater are visible at dusk, while its position is marked during the day-time by a white cloud, which rests upon its summit.&mdash;H. W. B.</p>
  <p>121. VOLCANIC BOMB, composed of <em>basaltic lava,</em> with numerous crystals of <em>glassy flespar.</em></p>
  <p>122. SCORIACEOUS BASALTIC LAVA, with crystals of <em>augite</em> and <em>glassy felspar.</em></p>
  <p><em>Upper Waipa, from the summit of Kokibako, an extinct volcano.</em></p>

  <p align="center">GEOLOGICAL MODEL OF ARTHUR'S SEAT,<br/>
    BY MR. ROBISON WRIGHT.</p>
  <p align="center">Re-coloured from the Map of the Geological Survey;<br/>
    BY ARCHIBALD GEIKIE, F.R.S.E.</p>
  <p>Arthur's Seat is the name of a hill about 820 feet high, and a square mile in extent, forming the eastern boundary of Edinburgh. It consists. of two parts, separated by the deep valley of the Hunter's Bog; that to the west rises from the streets of the town in a steep slope crowned by a semicircular mural escarpment, called Salisbury Craigs, which descends on the other side into the Hunter's Bog. The eastern portion of the bill is formed of successive terraces, with dividing valleys running north and south, their southern terminations being marked off by a confused pile of rock which slopes up from the north and east, and descends precipitously on the other sides. This higher part of the hill, which, seen from certain localities, looks like a great irregular cake laid down upon the lower ridges, is crowned by a crag of basalt forming the summit, or Arthur's Seat proper. To this peculiar contour the geology of the hill bears special reference. The ridges are all of hard trap; the intervening valleys consist of softer rocks, which have yielded more readily la disintegration; while the higher irregular mass of rock at the south side belongs to a much later age, and is really what it appears to be, a newer group of ridges set down on the tops of the older ones. The hill is thus of two distinct geological ages. The older rocks form part of the Lower Carboniferous Series, and are all inclined to the east at an average angle of about 20&deg;. The under or westerly part consists of a set of white, red, green, and mottled sandstones, fine conglomeratic grits, coarse limestones, and red and green</p>
