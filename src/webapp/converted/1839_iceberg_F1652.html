    <p align="center"><em>Note on a Rock seen on an Iceberg in </em>61&deg;<em> 
      South Latitude</em>. By CHARLES DARWIN, Esq.</p>
    <p>HAVING been informed by Mr. Enderby, that a block of rock, embedded in 
      ice, had been seen during the voyage of the schooner Eliza Scott in the 
      Antarctic Seas, I procured through his means an interview with Mr. Macnab, 
      one of the mates of the vessel, and I learnt from him the following facts:&mdash;On 
      the 13th of March, when in lat. 61&deg; S., and long. 103&deg; 40' E., a 
      black spot was seen on a distant iceberg, which, when the vessel had run 
      within a quarter mile of it, was clearly perceived to be an irregularly-shaped 
      but angular fragment of dark-coloured rock. It was embedded in a perpendicular 
      face of ice, at least 20 feet above the level of the sea. The part which 
      was visible, Mr. Macnab estimated at about 12 feet in height, and from 5 
      to 6 in width; the remainder (and from the dark colour of the surrounding 
      ice, probably the greater part) of the stone was concealed. He made a rough 
      sketch of it at the time, as represented at <a href="/published/rock.jpg" target="_blank">p. 
      524</a>. The iceberg which carried this fragment was between 250 and 300 
      feet high.</p>
    <p>Mr. Macnab informs me, that on one other occasion (about a</p>
    <p dar:class="page">[page] 529</p>
    <p>week afterwards) he saw on the summit of a low, flat iceberg, a black mass, 
      which he thinks, but will not positively assert, was a fragment of rock. 
      He has repeatedly seen, at considerable heights on the bergs, both reddish-brown 
      and blackish-brown ice. Mr. Mcnab attributes this discolouration to the 
      continued washing of the sea; and it seems probable that decayed ice, owing 
      to its porous texture, would filter every impurity from the waves which 
      broke over it.</p>
    <p>Every fact on the transportation of fragments of rock by ice is of importance, 
      as throwing light on the problem of 'erratic boulders,' which has so long 
      perplexed geologists; and the case first described possesses in some respects 
      peculiar interest. The part of the ocean, where the iceberg was seen, is 
      450 miles distant from <em>Sabrina</em> land (if such land exists), and 
      1400 miles from any certainly known land. The tract of sea, however, due 
      S., has not been explored; but assuming that land, if it existed there, 
      would have been seen at some leagues distance from a vessel, and considering 
      the southerly course which the schooner <em>Eliza Scott</em> pursued immediately 
      prior to meeting with the iceberg, and that of Cook in the year 1773, it 
      is exceedingly improbable that any land will hereafter be discovered within 
      100 miles south of this spot. The fragment of rock must, therefore, have 
      travelled at least thus far from its parent source; and, from being deeply 
      embedded, it probably sailed many miles farther on before it was dropped 
      from the iceberg in the depths of the sea, or was stranded on some distant 
      shore. In my Journal, during the voyage of H.M.S. <em>Beagle</em>, I have 
      stated (p. 282), on the authority of Captain Biscoe, that, during his several 
      cruises in the Antarctic Seas, he never once saw a piece of rock in the 
      ice. An iceberg, however, with a considerable block lying on it, was met 
      with to the E. of South Shetland, by Mr. Sorrell (the former boatswain of 
      the <em>Beagle</em>), when in a sailing vessel. The case, therefore, here 
      recorded is the second; but it is in many respects much the most remarkable 
      one. Almost every voyager in the Southern Ocean has described the extraordinary 
      number of icebergs, their vast dimensions, and the low latitudes to which 
      they are drifted: Horsburgh* has reported the case of several, which were 
      seen by a ship in her passage from India, in lat. 35&deg; 55<em>'</em> S. 
      If then but one iceberg in a thousand, or in ten thousand, transports its 
      fragment, the bottom of the Antarctic Sea, and the shores of its islands,&dagger; 
      must already be scattered with masses of foreign rock,&mdash;the counterpart 
      of the &quot;erratic boulders&quot; of the northern hemisphere.</p>

    <p class="style2">&dagger; M. Cordier, in his instructions (L'Institut, 1837, 
      p. 283) for the voyage of the <em>Astrolabe</em> and <em>Z&eacute;l&eacute;e</em>, 
      says, that the shores of South Shetland were found, by the naturalist of 
      an American expedition in 1830, covered with great erratic boulders of granite, 
      which were supposed to have been brought there by ice. It is highly desirable 
      that this fact should be inquired into, if any opportunity should herafter 
      occur.</p>
