    <h5 align="center">GEOLOGY.</h5>
    <p align="center"><strong>BY CHARLES DARWIN, ESQ., F.R.S., F.G.S.</strong></p>
    <p align="center">___</p>
    <p>A PERSON embarked on a naval expedition, who wishes to attend to Geology, 
      is placed in a position in some respects highly advantageous, and in others 
      as much to the contrary. He can hardly expect during his comparatively short 
      visits at one place, to map out the area and sequence of widely extended 
      formations: and the most important deductions in geology must ever depend 
      on this having been carefully executed; he must generally confine himself 
      to isolated sections and small areas, in which, however, there can be no 
      doubt many interesting facts may be collected. On the other hand, he is 
      admirably situated for studying the still active causes of those changes, 
      which, accumulated during long-continued ages, it is the object of geology 
      to record and explain. He is borne on the ocean, from which most sedimentary 
      formations have been deposited. During the soundings which are so frequently 
      carried on, he is excellently placed for studying the nature of the bottom, 
      and the distribution of the living organisms and dead remains strewed over 
      it. Again, on sea-shores, he can watch the breakers slowly eating into the 
      coast-cliffs, and he can examine their action</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="2">[page] 167</p>
    <p>under various circumstances: he here sees that going on in an infinitesimally
       small scale, which has planed down whole continents, levelled mountain-ranges,
       hollowed out great valleys, and exposed over wide areas rocks, which must
       have been formed or modified whilst heated under an enormous pressure.
      Again,  as almost every active volcano is situated close to, or within
      a few leagues  of the sea, he is admirably situated for investigating volcanic
      phenomena,  which in their striking aspect and simplicity, are well adapted
      to encourage  him in his studies.</p>
    <p>In the present state of the science, it may be doubted whether the mere 
      collection of fragments of rock without some detailed observations on the 
      district whence they are brought, is worthy of the time consumed and the 
      carriage of the specimens. The simple statement that one part of a coast 
      consists of granite, and another of sandstone or clay-slate, can hardly 
      be considered of any service to geology; and the labour thus thrown away 
      might have been more profitably spent, and thus saved the collector much 
      ultimate disappointment. It is now generally recognized that both the sedimentary 
      rocks, and those which have come from below in a softened state, are nearly 
      the same over the whole world. A mere fragment, with no other information 
      than the name of the place where collected, tells little more than this 
      fact. These remarks do not at all apply to the collection of fossil remains, 
      on which subject some remarks will presently be made; nor do they apply 
      to an observer collecting suites of rock-specimens with the intention of 
      himself subsequently drawing up an account of the structure and succession 
      of the strata in the countries visited.</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="3">[page] 168</p>
    <p>For this end, he can hardly collect too copiously, for errors in the naming 
      of the rocks may thus be corrected, and the careful comparison of such specimens 
      will often reveal to him curious relations which at the time he did not 
      suspect.</p>
    <p>In order to make observations of value, some reading and much careful thought 
      are necessary; but perhaps no science requires so little preparatory study 
      as geology, and none so readily yields, especially in foreign countries, 
      new and striking points of interest. Some of the highest problems in geology 
      wait on the observer in distant regions for explanation; such as, whether 
      the successive formations, as judged of by the character of their fossil 
      remains, correspond in distant parts of the world to those of Europe and 
      North America, or whether some of them may not correspond to blank epochs 
      of the north, when sedimentary beds either were not there accumulated, or 
      have been subsequently destroyed. Again, whether the lowest formation everywhere 
      is the same with that in which living beings are first present in the countries 
      best known to geologists. These and many other such wide views in the history 
      of the world are open to any one, who, applying thought and labour to his 
      subject, has the good fortune to geologise in little frequented countries.</p>
    <p>A person wishing to commence geology is often deterred by not knowing the 
      names of the rocks; but this is a knowledge, he may rely on it, easily 
      acquired. With half a dozen named crystalline rocks, or even by patiently 
      familiarizing his eye (aided by a lens) to the aspect of the feldspar and 
      quartz in granite, he will know the two most essential ingredients in most 
      igneous rocks; and in granite he will often find the glittering</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="4">[page] 169</p>
    <p>scales of mica replaced by a dark green mineral, less hard than the feldspar 
      and quartz; and then he will know the third most important mineral, hornblende. 
      The sedimentary rocks can hardly be described, except by the terms in common 
      use: impure limestone, which cannot be readily recognized by the eye, can 
      be distinguished by its effervescence with acids. By the repeated comparison 
      of freshly fractured sedimentary and igneous rocks, such as sandstone and 
      clay-slate on the one hand, and granite and lava on the other, he will learn 
      the difference between crystalline and mechanical structure; and this is 
      a very necessary point. Let no one be deterred from geology by the want 
      of mineralogical knowledge; many excellent geologists have known but little 
     ; and from this reason its value has perhaps sometimes been underrated, 
      for many of the obscurer points in geology, such as the nature of the metamorphic 
      changes in rocks, and all the phenomena of metallic and other veins, almost 
      require such knowledge. The appearances presented by the different forms 
      of stratification (that is, the original planes of deposition) may be soon 
      learnt in the field; though no doubt the beginner would be aided by the 
      diagrams given in many elementary works.</p>
    <p>The two most useful works which the geologist can carry with him, are
      without  doubt the 'Principles' and the 'Manual of Geology,' by Sir
      Charles Lyell.  He should procure a treatise on mineralogy, for instance,
      'Phillips's Mineralogy,'  by Allan. If he has the opportunity to procure
      others, Sir H. Delabeche's  'Researches in Theoretical Geology' would
      be particularly desirable from  discussing many of the questions which
      ought especially to engage the attention  of a</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="5">[page] 170</p>
    <p>sea voyager. As he will probably visit many volcanic regions, Dr. Daubeny's
       'Treatise on Volcanos' would be extremely useful; and a list is there
       given of special treatises on the volcanic countries likely to be visited
       by him. The 'Description Physique des Isles Canaries,' by Von Buch, may
       be cited as a model of descriptive powers. The voyager in the Temperate
       and Polar regions ought to have Agassiz' work on Glaciers. The geologist
       fortunately requires but little apparatus; a heavy hammer, with its two
       ends wedge-formed and truncated; a light hammer for trimming specimens
       ; some chisels and a pickaxe for fossils; a pocket-lens with three glasses
       (to be incessantly used); a compass and a clinometer, compose his essential
       tools. One of the simplest clinometers is that constructed by the Rev.
      Prof.  Henslow: it consists of a compass and spirit-level, fitted in a
      small square  box; in the lid there is a brass plate, graduated in a quadrant
      of 90 degrees,  with a little plumb-line to be suspended from a milled
      head at the apex  of the quadrant. The line of intersection of the edge
      of the clinometer,  when held horizontally, with the plane of the stratum,
      gives its strike,  range, or direction; and its dip or inclination, taken
      at right angles  to the strike, can be measured by the plumb-line. In an
      uneven country it  is not easy without the clinometer to judge which is
      the line of greatest  inclination of a stratum; and it is always more satisfactory
      to be certain  of the angle than to estimate it. A flat piece of rock representing
      the  general slope can usually be found, and by placing a note-book on
      it, the  measurement can be made very accurately. In studying the cleavage
      or slaty  structure of rocks, accurate observations are in-</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="6">[page] 171</p>
    <p>dispensable. A mouth blow-pipe with its apparatus, and a book with instructions 
      for its use (Phillips's Mineralogy contains brief directions), teaches a 
      little mineralogy in a pleasant manner. Besides the above instruments, a 
      mountain barometer is often very necessary: a portable level would, in 
      the case of raised sea-beaches and terraces, be useful. Messrs. Adie and 
      Son, of Edinburgh, sell a hand-level, a foot in length, which is fitted 
      with a little mirror on a hinge, so that the observer, whilst looking along 
      the level, can see when the bubble of air is central, and thus instantly 
      find his level in the surrounding district. This is a very valuable instrument. 
      Mr. R. Chambers, moreover, and others have found, that an observer having 
      previously ascertained the exact height of his eye when standing upright, 
      can measure the altitude of any point with some degree of accuracy; he 
      has only to mark by the level a recognizable stone or plant, and then to 
      walk to it, repeat the process, and keep an account how many times the levelling 
      has been repeated in ascending to the point, the height of which he wishes 
      to ascertain.</p>
    <p>A few cautions may be here inserted on the method of collecting. Every 
      single specimen ought to be numbered with a printed number (<em>those which 
      can be read upside down having a stop after them</em>) and a book kept exclusively 
      for their entry. As the value of many specimens entirely depends on the 
      stratum or locality whence they were procured being known, it is highly 
      necessary that every specimen should be ticketed on the same day when collected. 
      If this be not done, in after years the collector will never feel an absolute 
      certainty that his tickets and references are correct. It</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="7">[page] 172</p>
    <p>is very troublesome ticketing every separate fossil from the same stratum, 
      yet it is particularly desirable that this should be done; for when the 
      species are subsequently compared by naturalists, mistakes are extremely 
      liable to occur; and it should always be borne in mind, that misplaced 
      fossils are far worse than none at all. Pill-boxes are very useful for packing 
      fossils. Masses of clay or any soft rock may be brought home, if small fossil 
      shells are abundant in them. Rock-specimens should be about two or three 
      inches square, and half an inch thick; they should be folded up in paper. 
      To save subsequent trouble, it will be found convenient to pack up and mark 
      outside, sets of specimens from different localities. These details may 
      appear trifling; but few are aware of the labour of opening and arranging 
      a large collection, and such have seldom been brought home without some 
      errors and confusion having crept in.</p>
    <p>To a person not familiar with geological inquiry, on first landing on a 
      new coast, probably the simplest way of setting to work, is for him to imagine 
      a great trench cut across the country in a straight line, and that he has 
      to describe the position (that is, the angle of the dip and direction) and 
      nature of the different strata or masses of rock on either side. As, however, 
      he has not this trench or section, he must observe the dip and nature of 
      the rocks on the surface, and take advantage of every river-bank or cliff 
      where the land is broken, and of every quarry or well, always carrying the 
      beds and masses in his mind's eye to his imaginary section. In every case 
      this section ought to be laid down on paper, in as nearly as possible the 
      real proportional scale, copious notes should be made, and a large suite</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="8">[page] 173</p>
    <p>of specimens collected for <em>his own </em>future examination. The value 
      of sections, with their horizontal and vertical scales true to nature, cannot 
      be exaggerated, and their importance has only lately been appreciated to 
      the full extent. The habit of making even in the rudest manner sectional 
      diagrams is of great importance, and ought never to be omitted: it often 
      shows the observer palpably and before it is too late (a grief to which 
      every sea-voyager is particularly liable), where his knowledge is defective. 
      Partly for the same reason, and partly from never knowing, when first examining 
      a district, what points will turn out the most important, he ought to acquire 
      the habit of writing very copious notes, not all for publication, but as 
      a guide for himself. He ought to remember Bacon's aphorism, that &quot;Reading 
      maketh a full man, conference a ready man, and <em>writing an exact man </em>;&quot; 
      and no follower of science has greater need of taking precautions to attain 
      accuracy; for the imagination is apt to run riot when dealing with masses 
      of vast dimensions and with time during almost infinity. After the observer 
      has made a few traverses of the country, and drawn his sections (and the 
      coast-cliffs often afford him an invaluable one), he will be himself astonished, 
      in the most troubled country, over which the surface has been broken up 
      and re-cemented, almost like the fragments of ice on a great river, how 
      all the parts fall into intelligible order. He will in his mind see the 
      beds first horizontally stretched out one over the other in a fixed order, 
      and he will then perceive that all the disturbance has arisen from a few 
      nearly straight cracks, on the edges of which the beds have been upturned, 
      and between which he will sometimes find great wedges of</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="9">[page] 174</p>
    <p>once heat-softened, but now crystalline rocks. He will find that large 
      masses of strata have been removed and denuded, that is ground down into 
      pebbles and mud, and long ago drifted away to form in some other area newer 
      strata. He will now have a good idea of the physical structure of his district 
     ; and this much can be acquired with much greater facility than he will 
      at first readily anticipate.</p>
    <p>In examining a district to make a section, many minor points of detail
       will occur for observation, which can hardly be specified; such as the
       nature and cause of the transitions and alterations of the different 
      strata, the source of the sediment and pebbles, the alterations in chemical
       nature, either of the whole mass, or of parts, as in concretions; the
      presence,  and grouping and state of the fossil remains; the depth and
      condition of  the old sea-bottom, when the beds were deposited, and an
      infinity of similar  points: Probably the best method of obtaining this
      power of observation,  is to acquire the habit of always seeking an explanation
      of every geological  point met with; for one mental query leads on to another,
      and this will  at the same time give interest to his researches, and will
      lead him to compare  what is before his eyes, with all that he has read
      of or seen. With his  increasing knowledge he will daily find his powers
      of observation, his very  vision, become deeper and clearer. No one, however,
      must expect to solve  the many difficulties which will be encountered,
      and which for a long time  will remain to perplex geologists; but a ray
      of light will occasionally  be his reward, and the reward is ample.</p>
    <p><em>Organic Remains.&mdash;</em>In the sectional diagram which we have supposed 
      to be made, the simple superposition</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="10">[page] 175</p>
    <p>of the beds gives their relative antiquity; but the best section which 
      a sea-voyager can hope to make, will seldom include but a small portion 
      of the long sequence of known geological formations. And as the voyager 
      seldom passes over large districts, he will rarely succeed in placing in 
      proper order, by the aid of superposition alone, the formations which he 
      successively meets with even in the same country. Hence he must, more than 
      any other geologist, rely on the characters of the embedded organic remains, 
      and must sedulously collect every specimen and fragment of a specimen. By 
      the means of fossil remains, not only will he be enabled to arrange (with 
      the help of naturalists on his return home) the formations in the same country 
      according to their age, but their contemporaneity with the deposits of the 
      most distant parts of the world can thus and by no other method be ascertained 
     ; for it is now known that at each geological epoch the marine animals partook 
      in the most distant quarters of a general similarity, even when none of 
      the species were identically the same: thus beds have been recognized in 
      North and South America, and in India, which must have been deposited when 
      the chalk in Europe was accumulating beneath the sea.</p>
    <p>It is highly necessary most carefully to keep the fossils found in different 
      strata separate; it will often occur in passing upwards from one bed to 
      another, and occasionally even without any great change in the character 
      of the rock, that the fossils will be wholly different; and if such distinct 
      sets of fossils are mingled together, as if found together, undoubtedly 
      it would have been better for the progress of science that they had never 
      been collected. As there is some inconve-</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="11">[page] 176</p>
    <p>nience in keeping the fossils collected on the same day separate, this 
      caution is the more requisite. The collector, if he be not an experienced 
      naturalist, should be very cautious in rejecting specimens, from thinking 
      them the same with what he has already got; for it requires years of practice 
      to perceive at once the small, but constant, distinctions which often separate 
      species: the same species, moreover, if collected in different localities, 
      or in beds one placed far above the other, are generally more valuable to 
      the geologist than new species.</p>
    <p>In formations from a few hundred to a thousand feet and upwards in thickness, 
      the whole of which does actually belong to the same geological age, and 
      is therefore characterized by the same fossils, most curious and important 
      results may be sometimes deduced, if the position or relative heights at 
      which the groups of fossils are embedded be noted; and this is a point 
      usually neglected. For, thanks to the researches of Professor E. Forbes, 
      the depth of water under which a collection of shells lived can now be approximately 
      told; and thus the movement of the crust of the earth, whilst the strata 
      including the shells were accumulating, can be inferred. For instance, if 
      at the bottom of a cliff, say 800 feet in height, a set of shells are buried, 
      which must have lived under water only 50 or 100 feet in depth; it is clear 
      that the bottom of the sea must have sunk to have allowed of the deposition 
      of the 700 feet of superincumbent submarine strata; subsequently the whole 
      800 feet must have been upraised. For this same purpose, and for other ends, 
      it is desirable that it should be noted which species are the most numerous, 
      and whether layers are composed exclusively of single</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="12">[page] 177</p>
    <p>kinds. It should be also remarked, whether the more delicate bivalve shells 
      retain their two valves united, and whether the burrowing kinds are embedded 
      in their natural positions, as these facts show that the shells have not 
      been drifted from afar. Where there are fossil corals, it should be observed 
      whether the greater number of specimens are upright, in the positions in 
      which they grew. The remark formerly made that the collection of mere fragments 
      of rock is of little or no use to geology, is far from applicable to fossil 
      remains. Every single fossil species, bones, shells, Crustacea, corals, 
      impressions of leaves, petrified wood, &amp;c., should be collected, and 
      it is scarcely possible to collect too many specimens. Even a single species 
      without any information of any kind, if it prove a quite new form, will 
      be valuable to the zoologist; if it prove identical with, or closely allied 
      to a known species, it may interest the geologist. A set of fossils, however, 
      and still more several sets, with their superposition known, cannot fail 
      to be of the highest value; they will tell the age of the deposit, and 
      perhaps give the key to the whole geology of the country: some of the most 
      interesting problems in this science will be solved only when large collections 
      have been carefully made in distant regions of the world.</p>
    <p>A collection of recent shells (both those living on the coast and those 
      to be procured by the dredge off it) from the same country or island at 
      which a collection of tertiary fossil shells is made, is generally of very 
      great service to the palaeontologist, who undertakes the description of 
      the fossils. The collecting recent shells will,, moreover, with the aid 
      of a little study, teach the geologist some conchology, and this is an acquirement</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="13">[page] 178</p>
    <p>yearly becoming more necessary: the geologist should exert himself to 
      learn some general zoology.</p>
    <p>The bones of vertebrated animals are much more rarely found than the remains 
      of the lower marine animals, and they are almost in proportion more valuable. 
      A person not acquainted with the science will hardly be able to imagine 
      the deep interest which the discovery of a skeleton, if of higher organization 
      than a fish, in any of the oldest formations would most justly create. The 
      age of such a formation would have to be judged of by the co-embedded shells, 
      and therefore, if possible, part of the slab containing the bones should 
      include one or two shells to demonstrate their contemporaneity. Bones, however, 
      from any formation are sure to be valuable; even a single tooth, in the 
      hands of a Cuvier or Owen, will unfold a whole history; the heads, jaws, 
      and articular surfaces are the most valuable; but every fragment should 
      be brought home. Where bones are found close together, and especially if 
      some of the parts lie in their natural positions, they should be packed 
      together. Every bone, if found even six inches beneath the black vegetable 
      mould, should be collected; there can be no doubt that many most valuable 
      relics have been neglected, from the supposition that they belonged to still 
      living animals. Low cliffs of mud, gravel, and clay on the banks of streams 
      and on sea-shores (as well as in bared reefs extending from them), are the 
      most likely places for the discovery of the remains of quadrupeds. Gravel 
      beds under streams of lava; fissures in volcanic rocks; peat beds, and 
      the clay or marl underlying peat, are all favourable places. Fishes' bones 
      are found occasionally in all sedimentary strata, and are highly interesting.</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="14">[page] 179</p>
    <p><em>Caverns.&mdash;</em>These most frequently occur in limestone rocks, and they 
      have yielded a truly wonderful harvest of remains in Europe, South America, 
      and Australia. The bones generally occur in mud, under a stalagmitic crust 
      produced by the dripping of the lime-charged water, which requires being 
      broken up by a pickaxe. As caverns have often been used by wild races of 
      man as places of habitation and burial, a most careful examination should 
      be made to detect any signs of the surface having been anciently broken 
      up near where the bones are found. Even small islands, not now inhabited 
      by any land quadruped, if not very distant from a continent, are almost 
      as likely to contain osseous remains as larger tracts of land. The interest 
      of the discovery of the remains of land quadrupeds in an oceanic island 
      would be extreme: for instance, it has been -stated that the tooth of a 
      mastodon has been found in one of the Azores; if this were confirmed, few 
      geologists would doubt that these islands had once been united to Europe, 
      thus enlarging wonderfully our ideas of the ancient geography of the Atlantic 
     : so also the remains of a mastodon are said to have been brought from Timor, 
      thus perhaps indicating the road by which this great quadruped formerly 
      reached Australia.</p>
    <p><em>Fossil Footsteps.&mdash;</em>As allied to organic remains, fossil footsteps 
      may be here referred to. They have been observed in Europe and North America, 
      but hitherto in no other part of the world. These curious vestiges not only 
      proclaim the former existence of reptiles and birds at very remote periods, 
      and in rocks often not containing a fragment of bone, but they generally 
      prove that the level of the land subsided after the animal had</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="15">[page] 180</p>
    <p>left its impress on the ancient sea-beach, thus allowing thousands of feet 
      of strata to he thrown down over them. The best place for searching for 
      footsteps is in quarries of sandstone, in which the strata are separated 
      by seams of shale. The best indication of their probable occurrence is the 
      rock being &quot;rippled,&quot; that is marked with narrow little wavy ridges, such 
      as occur on most sandy shores when the tide is down, and which indicate 
      that the now rocky surface was once either a tidal beach or a shallow surface, 
      over which the ancient animals walked. In the case of fossil footsteps being 
      found, the largest slab which could possibly be removed ought to be brought 
      away, and accurate drawings, or still better, casts, made of several of 
      the footsteps. A plan from accurate measurement ought to be taken of any 
      row of steps. The value of such fossil footsteps would be in a manifold 
      degree increased, if the age of the deposit could be determined by shells 
      found in the same stratum, or above it.</p>
    <p><em>Coal Deposits.&mdash;</em>The origin of coal presents a most curious and difficult 
      problem in geology, and though a vast amount of information has been accumulated 
      on the subject, yet good observations in distant countries would be of the 
      highest value. A very brief statement of the most prominent difficulties 
      in the theory of its origin will, perhaps, be the best guide for further 
      inquiries. If we look first to the coal itself, the frequency with which, 
      both in Europe and North America, upright vegetables have been found in 
      and on the coal, and the curious relation between the presence of coal, 
      and the nature of the clayey bed (abounding with roots) on which it rests, 
      can leave no doubt that in these so frequent instances the vegetation, whence 
      the coal has</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="16">[page] 181</p>
    <p>been derived, grew on the spot where now embedded. The regularity and wide 
      extent of the beds of coal, and especially of certain subordinate seams 
      in them, the stratification and fineness of the deposits alternating with 
      the coal, and the rarity of channels (such as would have been formed by 
      a stream or river) cutting through the associated strata, all seem pretty 
      clearly to indicate that the coal was not formed on the surface, like a 
      mass of peat, but under water. What, then, was the nature of those vast 
      expanses of shallow water under which the coal was accumulated? The character 
      of the upright fossil plants, according to our present knowledge, absolutely 
      contradicts the idea of their having lived in the sea; yet occasionally 
      strata, containing undoubted marine remains, are associated with the carboniferous 
      series. On the other hand, how can we believe that lakes, allowing of course 
      their beds slowly to sink, could contain the enormous thickness, amounting 
      in some instances to several thousand yards, of the coal-bearing strata 
    ? Or are we to suppose that, whilst a broad belt of low land with extensive 
      lagoons, near the mouth of some great river, very gradually subsided,' mud 
      and sand was deposited at such a rate on the surface as to keep up the level, 
      so that the waters of the sea were prevented, excepting in rare instances, 
      breaking into the lagoons with their luxuriant vegetation? On this view, 
      or indeed on any such view, after long-continued subsidence, sufficient 
      to bury even a lofty mountain-chain, whence, it may be asked, was derived 
      the sediment which formed the great pile of strata alternating with the 
      coal?-Must not an adjoining area have gone on rising, whilst the coal-bearing 
      strata continued to sink? From these few remarks it</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="17">[page] 182</p>
    <p>will be seen how many points deserve careful examination in any new coal 
      district; the chief points being, the presence of upright vegetables and 
      trunks of trees (of the position of which careful drawings should be made), 
      and whether furnished with roots,—the nature of the beds on which the coal 
      rests, and generally of all the strata; the continuousness and form of 
      the strata, and whether ripple-marked; the existence of marine animal remains, 
      and whether such lived on the spot, or were drifted into their present positions, 
      and many other similar points. It is superfluous to observe that all fossil 
      plants should be collected; those found upright should be carefully distinguished 
      from those embedded horizontally. The contents of any upright stems and 
      of the roots should be examined; as it appears they have generally first 
      become hollow from decay, and then been filled up with mud, which in some 
      instances is charged with seeds and leaves.</p>
    <p><em>Salt Deposits.&mdash;</em>Information is much required on this subject; and 
      this is a case in which good suites of specimens, illustrating the nature 
      of the rocks beneath and above the salt, would possess much interest. Do 
      they contain any organic remains? Did such live on the spot where now buried 
    ? Do the rocks show signs of having undergone in any degree the action of 
      heat? Are the strata regular, or are they crossed by oblique layers, showing 
      the probable action of currents? Are there ripple-marks, or beds of coarse 
      pebbles, or other indications of the strata having been deposited in shallow 
      water? What is the thickness, form, and dimensions of the beds of salt 
    ? Specimens of the salt, and of any associated saline substances, ought 
      to be brought home in bottles for analysis. The origin of</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="18">[page] 183</p>
    <p>beds of salt, found in formations of very different ages in different parts 
      of the world, is at present quite obscure; some authors attribute it to 
      the sinking of superficial sea-water, rendered more saline by evaporation 
     ; others to the evaporation of sea-water periodically overflowing extensive 
      low sandy tracts, like parts of the Run of Cutch; others suspect that its 
      deposition is in some unknown way connected with the sea's bottom having 
      been heated by volcanic action. In some countries there are large lakes 
      of brine, often covering thick beds of salt; these deserve examination 
     : on what does such salt or brine rest, whether on the bared underlying 
      strata, or on sand or gravel, such as cover the surrounding country? Does 
      the salt contain the remains of animals or plants? Specimens of the salt 
      ought to be brought home in bottles, and attention paid, whether beneath 
      it there is any thin layer of other saline substances.</p>
    <p><em>Cleavage.&mdash;</em>The slaty structure of rocks will at first perplex the 
      young geologist; for in proportion as it becomes well developed, the planes 
      of stratification or of original deposition become obscure, and are often 
      quite obliterated. As the sea-voyager, and especially the surveyor, often 
      visits numerous points on the same line of coast, he possesses some great 
      advantages for studying this subject, and numerous observations made with 
      care would probably give striking results. The range or strike of the cleavage 
      is uniform over surprisingly large areas; whereas both the angle and point 
      of dip varies much; but there is reason to believe that the planes of inclination, 
      examined across a wide tract transversely to the range, will fall into order 
      and show that they are the truncated edges of a few</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="19">[page] 184</p>
    <p>great curves or domes. The relation of the cleavage-planes to those of 
      the stratification, or axes of elevation, should be carefully noted, and 
      likewise to the general outline of the whole country. Long sections at right 
      angles to the strike of the cleavage, with the dip carefully protracted 
      on paper, would be highly interesting. When two chains of hills, each having 
      its independent cleavage, cross each other, careful observations should 
      be made. In all cases, any mineralogical difference, however slight, in 
      the parallel cleavage-layers, deserves attention; but observations on this 
      head would be hardly trustworthy, without the planes of stratification were 
      so distinct that there could be no possibility of confounding (as has often 
      happened) cleavage and stratification. Where a stratum of sandstone, or 
      of any other rock without cleavage, is interstratified with a slaty rock, 
      the surface of junction ought to be minutely examined, to see if the slate 
      has slipped along the planes of cleavage, or whether again the mass has 
      not been either stretched or compressed at right angles to these same planes. 
      Fossil shells have been found by Mr. Sharpe in slaty rocks, which have had 
      their shapes greatly altered, and all in the same direction; here then 
      we have a guide to judge of the amount and direction of the mechanical displacement 
      which the surrounding slate-rocks have undergone.* Observations on cleavage, 
      to be useful, must be numerous and very accurately made.</p>
    <p class="style2">* With respect to further observations on this important 
      point, Mr. Hopkins remarks, in his paper &quot;On the Internal Pressure of Rock 
      Masses&quot; (Cambridge Philosoph. Transact, vol. viii.), that &quot;the observer 
      should direct his attention especially to those cases in which the inclination 
      of the cleavage planes to the bedding is either small, or nearly 45&deg;.&quot;</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="20">[page] 185</p>
    <p>The foliation of the metamorphic schists, that is, the origin of the layers 
      of quartz,' mica, feldspar, and other minerals, of which gneiss, micaceous, 
      chloritic, and hornblendic schists are composed, is intimately connected 
      with the cleavage of homogeneous slaty rocks. Nearly all. the proposed observations 
      on cleavage are applicable to foliation. Wherever large districts of foliated 
      and ordinary slaty rocks unite, observations would be most desirable. These 
      foliated rocks have all undergone metamorphic action, that is, they have 
      been mineralogically altered and rendered crystalline by chemical attraction, 
      aided by heat; but this latter is a most obscure subject, one on which 
      it would appear that much further light will not be thrown without the aid 
      of a profound knowledge of mineralogy or chemistry. It is now known that 
      granitic rocks, which have been fluidified (as may be told by their sending 
      great veins into, and including fragments of, the overlying rocks), are 
      foliated in a more or less perfect degree: in these cases the relation 
      of the planes of foliation with those of the adjoining rocks, which have 
      been metamorphosed but not fluidified, would be eminently curious.</p>
    <p><em>Nature of the Sea-bottom.&mdash;</em>As every sedimentary stratum has once 
      existed as the bed of the sea or of a lake, the importance of observations 
      on this head is obvious; and no one is so favourably circumstanced for 
      making them as a naval officer on a surveying expedition. The limits of 
      depth under different latitudes at which the various, marine animals live 
      or are found strewed dead, is perhaps the most important point for further 
      investigation which can be suggested in the science of geology: scarcely 
      any observations with the dredge have been made within the tropics.</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="21">[page] 186</p>
    <p>Not only the shells, corals, sea-urchins, crabs, &amp;c., brought up from 
      different stated depths, should be preserved, but the proportionate numbers 
      of each kind be carefully noted, as well as the nature of the sea-bottom. 
      An observer could not labour too much in this line, and especially if he 
      would subsequently himself undertake to tabulate and work out the results.*</p>
    <p>There is another point of view under which the bed of the sea would amply
       repay long-continued observations. It is well known that the nature of
      the  bottom often changes very regularly in approaching a coast; the pebbles,
       for instance, increasing in size in a surprisingly steady ratio with the
       decreasing depth. But the means by which the pebbles are thus sorted is
       not known: is it by the oscillation of the waves at ordinary periods,
      or  only during gales; or is it by the action of currents? A chart, with
      the  nature of the bottom carefully noted on it and the currents laid down,
      would  by itself throw some light on this question. The nature of the pebbles
      being  observed, perhaps a point would be found whence they radiated. Excellent
       observations have been made by engineers on the travelling of shingle-beaches,
       but scarcely anything is known of their movement under water. In what
      condition  are the pebbles?&mdash;are they encrusted (as often happens)
      with delicate corallines after  a heavy gale are the spines of such corallines
      found broken? In narrow  channels where there are rapid currents, and in
      the open sea in front of  straits, where the water often suddenly deepens,
      what is the nature of the</p>
    <p class="style2">* The best kind of dredge, and the manner of using it, are 
      described under the Zoological Section.</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="22">[page] 187</p>
    <p>bottom? To what depth does the sea in a storm render the water muddy? 
      How far from the beach, and to what depth, does the recoil of the waves, 
      or the &quot;undertow,&quot; act, for instance, on light anchors? At what depth 
      can the sea wear solid rock? This may sometimes be judged of by the nature 
      of the bottom; thus, when soft mud overlies, at all times, even after gales 
      of wind, a submarine rocky surface, which from the nature of the adjoining 
      coast-strata we may feel sure has been worn down, we may infer that the 
      sea at its present level, and under existing circumstances, is not a destroying 
      but a depositing and protecting agent. Is it at the line of high or low 
      water, or between them, that the breakers most vigorously eat into coast-cliffs 
    ? Gigantic fragments of rock, much too large to be themselves rolled about, 
      may be seen at the foot of almost every line of high cliffs; by what means 
      in the course of time will these be 'removed, as must have happened with 
      their innumerable predecessors? Are they slowly worn away or broken up 
    ? It may be well to recollect that in the tropics the powerful action of 
      frost in splitting stones is entirely eliminated. Our observations, moreover, 
      on the alluvial and sub-littoral deposits of these latitudes are not perplexed 
      by the ancient effects of floating ice. The spray of salt-water, above the 
      line of breakers, corrodes by chemical decomposition calcareous rocks; 
      does this play any important part on other rocks? Most bold coasts are 
      fronted by sharp promontories and even isolated pinnacles; are these <em>exclusively 
      </em>due to the greater hardness of the rocks composing them, or do not the 
      breakers act more efficiently when eddying round any slight projection?</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="23">[page] 188</p>
    <p>Rocks rising steeply out of the open ocean, and exposed to the incessant 
      wash of the heaviest surf, are often thickly coated over with various marine 
      animals, and this would seem to indicate that pure water has not the power 
      of gradually wearing away hard rocks, though the waves may occasionally 
      tear off large fragments. Is the washing to and fro of pebbles, or of sand, 
      a necessary element in the corroding power of waves on hard rocks? but 
      how comes it that small land-locked harbours, where the waves can hardly 
      have force to move the shingle, should ever be surrounded by cliffs, which, 
      in most cases, clearly prove that considerable masses of rock have been 
      worn down into mud and removed? Again, at a moderate depth, where the bottom 
      is covered with shingle, does the rolling to and fro of the pebbles wear 
      away solid rock? if so, the pebbles would be clean, and the submarine rocky 
      surface probably worn into furrows or channels at right angles to the beach. 
      Where there are violent currents and eddies, are deep round holes worn in 
      the bottom, like those produced by eddies at the foot of cascades? This, 
      perhaps, might be ascertained by a long pole at the turn of the tide: deep 
      round holes have been observed on rocks formerly covered by the sea, and 
      their origin has perplexed geologists. Any person steadily attending to 
      these subjects will occasionally be enabled to form an opinion on points 
      at first appearing hopelessly obscure to him. The common deep-sea lead, 
      especially if made a little bell-shaped and well armed, gives a surprisingly 
      good picture of the bottom. There can be no doubt that whoever will for 
      a long period collect and compare observations, made over wide areas and 
      under differ-</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="24">[page] 189</p>
    <p>ent circumstances, will arrive at many curious, novel, and important results.</p>
    <p>An observer occasionally may arrive at a district where lately some great 
      aqueous catastrophe has occurred, such as the bursting of a lake temporarily 
      formed by a slip, or the rush of a great earthquake-wave over low land. 
      In such cases all the effects produced, such as the thickness and nature 
      of any deposit left-whether stratified irregularly or continuously- whether 
      any rocky surface, over which the debacle has passed, be scored or smooth 
     ; all such points should be minutely described, and measurements taken of 
      any great blocks which may have been transported: the great desideratum 
      is accuracy and minuteness.</p>
    <p><em>Ice Action.&mdash;</em>The voyager in the Polar Seas would render an excellent 
      service to geology by observing all the effects which icebergs produce in 
      rounding, polishing, scoring, and shattering solid rocks, and likewise in 
      transporting gravel and boulders. Floating ice under two forms is known 
      to transport fragments; namely, coast-ice, in which the stranded boulders 
      are frozen, and icebergs formed by glaciers entering the sea, on the surface 
      of which masses of rock had previously fallen from the surrounding precipices. 
      It is obvious that in the latter case the fragments would generally be quite 
      angular, and they could not be landed in water shallower than the thickness 
      of the submerged ice, requisite to float the berg. On the other hand, the 
      boulders frozen in coast-ice would generally be previously water-worn, and 
      they could be landed on an ordinary beach, and might be driven by the force 
      of the pack high and dry, and perhaps left piled in strange positions. All 
      facts illustrating the</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="25">[page] 190</p>
    <p>difference in the results produced by coast-ice and true icebergs would 
      be very valuable. Do the boulders fixed on coast-ice, when driven over rocky 
      shoals, become themselves scored? Wherever there was reason to believe 
      that a surface had been scored by recent ice-action, a minute description 
      and drawings ought to be made of the depth, length, width, and direction 
      of the grooves; and even large slabs brought home. On true icebergs, are 
      the fragments of rock generally fixed or loose; when icebergs turn over, 
      are fragments frequently seen embedded in that part which was under water 
     ; and how were they fixed there? The nature, number, size, form, and frequency 
      of occurrence of all fragments of rock seen on floating ice ought to be 
      recorded, and the distance from their probable source. A polar shore, known 
      from upraised organic remains to have been lately elevated, would be eminently 
      instructive. Do great icebergs force up the mud and gravel at the bottom 
      of the sea in ridges like the moraines of glaciers? Can shells, or other 
      marine animals, live in a shallow sea, often ploughed up and rendered turbid 
      by the stranding of icebergs? The dredge alone could answer this. The means 
      to distinguish the effects of ancient floating ice from those produced by 
      ancient glaciers is, at present, a great desideratum in geology. M. Agassiz' 
      work on Glaciers, with its admirable plates, ought to be procured by any 
      one going to the colder regions of the north or south.</p>
    <p>Erratic boulders occur in Europe, N. America, and in the southern parts 
      of S. America, which, it is believed by most geologists, were transported 
      by ice; those near mountains, by ancient glaciers; and those</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="26">[page] 191</p>
    <p>on the lowlands, by floating ice. Erratic boulders, when not of gigantic 
      size, may be confounded with rounded stones, transported by occasional great 
      floods or by the coast-action of the surf during slow changes of level of 
      the land. Masses of granite, from often disintegrating into large, apparently 
      water-worn boulders, and then rolling downwards, have several times been 
      erroneously described <em>as </em>belonging to the erratic class. Where the 
      nature of all the rocks in the vicinity is not perfectly known, great size 
      and the angularity of the fragments (though by no means a constant concomitant) 
      are the most obvious distinctive characters; but even when the surrounding 
      country is not at all known, the composition of a single isolated hill or 
      small island may easily be ascertained, and if large fragments of foreign 
      rock lie strewed on its surface, these may be assumed almost certainly to 
      be erratic boulders. Here, however, a caution has been found necessary; 
      for in the case of fragments of <em>sedimentary </em>rocks, they may be the 
      last remnant of a denuded overlying formation. Wherever erratic boulders 
      are found, their composition, form - especially attending to whether they 
      are angular, water-worn, or scored, and their size, from actual, though 
      rude measurements, should be given.</p>
    <p>Both in the north and south a peculiar formation called &quot;till&quot; has been 
      found connected with erratic boulders; it consists generally of mud, containing 
      angular and rounded stones of all sizes up to the largest boulders, mingled 
      in utter confusion, and generally without any stratification. Such deposits 
      should be examined. Sometimes when they are stratified, the upper beds have 
      been found violently contorted, whilst</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="27">[page] 192</p>
    <p>the lower ones are undisturbed, showing that the violence has not proceeded 
      from below, as in ordinary geological cases. Sir C. Lyell has suggested 
      that this effect has been produced by the stranding of great icebergs.</p>
    <p>As far as our present knowledge goes, the above enumerated phenomena&mdash;such
       as scored, mamillated, and polished rocks, moraines, erratic boulders,
      and  beds of till, though occurring in latitudes where glaciers do not
      now occur,  where the sea is never frozen, and where icebergs are never
      drifted, yet  have not been observed in either hemisphere higher than about
      latitude 40&deg;. 
      Hence, on whatever coast ancient ice-action might be discovered, the limit
       of latitude towards the tropics at which it ceases ought to be carefully
       investigated. Observations are much wanted on the west coast of N. America
       and the east coast of Asia; and again in New Zealand and other islands
       of the Southern Ocean. The period of the ice-action is pretty well ascertained
       in Europe and North America, and a very great service would be rendered
       to geology if the same point could be clearly made out in the southern
      hemisphere  ; for it might greatly influence our ideas on the climate of
      the world during  the late tertiary periods. Any shells embedded in &quot;till&quot; (though,
      unfortunately,  of very rare occurrence) would decide this point, and it
      might probably  be closely judged of, if till or boulders were found resting
      on, or covered  by, shell deposits.</p>
    <p><em>Distribution of Organic Beings.&mdash;</em>As geology includes the history 
      of the organic inhabitants, as well as of the inorganic materials, of the 
      world, facts on distribution come under its scope. Earth has been ob-</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="28">[page] 193</p>
    <p>served on icebergs in the open ocean; portions of such earth ought to 
      be collected, washed with fresh water, filtered, gently dried, wrapped up 
      in brown paper, and sent home by the first opportunity to be tried, with 
      due precautions, whether any seeds still alive are included in it. Again, 
      the roots of any tree cast up on an island in the open ocean should be split 
      open, to see if any earth or stones are included (as often happens), and 
      this earth ought to be treated like that from icebergs: it is truly surprising 
      how many seeds are often contained in extremely small portions of earth. 
      Any graminivorous bird, caught far out at sea, ought to have the contents 
      of its intestines dried for the same object. The zoologist who, with a towing-net, 
      fishes for floating minute animals, ought to observe whether seeds are thus 
      taken. These experiments, though troublesome, undoubtedly, would be well 
      worth trying. All facts or traditional statements by the inhabitants of 
      any island or coral-reef, on the first arrival of any bird, reptile, insect, 
      or remarkable plant, ought to be collected. In those rare cases in which 
      showers of fish, reptiles, shells, earth, seeds, conferva, &amp;c., have 
      fallen from the sky, every fact should be recorded, and specimens collected.</p>
    <p><em>Volcanic Phenomena.&mdash;</em>The voyager will probably have ample opportunities 
      of examining volcanic islands, and perhaps volcanoes in eruption. With respect 
      to the latter, he ought to record all that he sees: should the exact position 
      of the orifice be known, he might, perhaps, by observing some point in a 
      cloud, measure with a sextant to what height the fragments were shot forth, 
      and the height of the often flat-topped column of ashes. Having surveying 
      instruments, he ought to</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="29">[page] 194</p>
    <p>map, as carefully as time will permit, any crater remarkable for its size, 
      depth, or peculiar form. M. Elle de Beaumont has found that, owing to the 
      fluidity of lava, streams never consolidate into a thick, moderately-compact 
      mass, except on a surprisingly gentle inclination. On a slope of above 2&deg; 
      or 3&deg;, the stream consists of extremely irregular masses, often forming 
      a hollow vault within. Fresh observations on this point are much wanted 
      in regard to lavas of different composition. The measurements can easily 
      be made by a sextant and artificial horizon.* In making such observations, 
      comparatively recent streams must be chosen, so that there can be no doubt 
      that the whole consists of a single stream: this cannot be judged of</p>
    <p class="style2">* M. Elle de Beaumont gives the following directions (M&eacute;moires 
      pour servir, &amp;c., tom. iv. p. 173) :&mdash;</p>
    <p class="style2">&quot;The method I am in the habit of employing for these
      kinds  of measurements is simple and easy, and a description of it may
      save useless  trouble to others. I place on the edge of the sextant, and
      behind the fixed  mirror, a small piece of white paper, in which there
      is a narrow opening  (ouverture &eacute;troite) corresponding to the axis
      of the telescope. On  the exterior surface of the paper a black line is
      drawn, perpendicular to  the plan of the graduated circle, and passing
      through the centre of the  opening above mentioned. A quantity of mercury
      is poured into a vessel sufficient  to form a plane horizontal surface
      of a certain extent. The telescope of  the sextant is then directed vertically
      over the mercury, and the image  of the black line sought for. When this
      is found, 1 am certain that the  visual ray from the image in the mercury
      can only deviate from the perpendicular,  in so far as the line is not
      without breadth, and the opening has a sensible  size. These two sources
      of error can be diminished so that the maximum of  error shall not exceed
      a minute. Being once certain of the verticality of  the visual ray from
      the image of the black line, I have only to make the  image of any object
      reflected from the moveable mirror coincide with that  of the black line,
      to have the angle between the vertical, and the line  drawn from the centre
      of the instrument to the object in question, which  may be any distant
      point on the surface of a bed of lava, a glacier, a road,  a river, &amp;c.&quot;</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="30">[page] 195</p>
    <p>without examining the whole line between the two points of measurement, 
      for some liquid lavas thin out to a very fine edge; and two streams, one 
      over the other, may be thus very easily mistaken for a single one. The composition, 
      thickness, and degree of cellularity of any lava-stream, of which the slope 
      is measured, ought to be described as seen on the sides of fissures, and 
      wherever its internal structure can be made out.</p>
    <p>Round many active and extinct volcanoes, both on continents and on islands,
       there is a circle of mountains, steep on their inner, and gently inclined
       on their outer flanks. The volcanic strata, of which they are composed,
       everywhere dip away from the central space, but at a considerably higher
       angle than it is believed lava can consolidate into such thick and compact
       masses. These mountains form the so-called &quot;craters of elevation,&quot; the
        origin of which has excited much controversy, and which demand further
       examination.  There is a grand range of mountains of this class at the
       Mauritius and at  St. Jago in the Cape de Verdes, parts only of which
       have been described.  The chief points to attend to are, the <em>inclination </em>of
       the streams  by actual measurement, their thickness, compactness, and
       composition; the  form and height of the mountains, and whether they
       have suffered much wear  and tear from the ancient action of the sea when
       the land stood at a lower  level, for Sir C. Lyell has lately attributed
       their origin almost exclusively  to this agency; and whether they are
       traversed by very many dikes, of which  the common direction ought to
       be recorded; how far the mountains stand  apart, and the diameter and
       outline of the rude circle which they together  form.</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="31">[page] 196</p>
    <p>In fact, a most useful service would be rendered by mapping any of these 
      &quot;craters of elevation,&quot; or, what would be more feasible, drawing
      from actual  measurements two sections at right angles to each other, across
      the circle.</p>
    <p>Some streams of lava, especially those belonging to the trachytic series
       (harsh, generally rather pale-coloured lavas, with crystals of glassy
      feldspar),  are laminated. The course of the layers with respect to the
      course of the  stream ought to be minutely studied, both on the surface,
      at the termination,  and flanks of the stream; and, if by a most fortunate
      chance there should  have been formed a transverse section, throughout
      its entire thickness:  this would be a very interesting subject for investigation.
      A series of  specimens ought' to be brought away to illustrate the nature
      of the lamination.</p>
    <p><em>Aerial Dust.&mdash;</em>Fine brown-coloured dust has often fallen on vessels 
      far out at sea, more especially in the middle of the Atlantic. This should 
      be collected; the direction and force of the wind (and the course of any 
      upper current, as shown by the movement of the clouds) on the same day, 
      and for some previous days, ought to be recorded, as well as the date, and 
      the position of the ship. Such dust has been shown by Ehrenberg to consist, 
      in many cases, almost entirely of the siliceous envelopes of infusoria. 
      The distance to which real volcanic dust is blown is, likewise, in some 
      respects well worth determining.</p>
    <p><em>Elevation of the Land.&mdash;</em>The changes of level, often accompanying 
      earthquakes, will be treated of by Mr. Mallet, but a few remarks on the 
      nature of the evidence to be sought, on changes of level not actually</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="32">[page] 197</p>
    <p>witnessed by man, may be here inserted. Many appearances, such as lines 
      of inland cliffs, of sand-hillocks, eroded rocks, and banks of shingle, 
      often indicate the former effects of the sea on the land when the latter 
      stood at a lower level. But the best evidence, and the only kind by which 
      the period can be ascertained (for the appearances above enumerated, though 
      well preserved, may sometimes be of considerable antiquity), is the presence 
      of upraised recent marine remains. On land which has been elevated within 
      a geologically recent time, sea shells are often found, either embedded 
      in thin layers of sand and mould, or scattered on the bare surface. In these 
      cases, and especially in the latter case, great caution is requisite in 
      testing the evidence; for man, birds, and hermit-crabs often transport, 
      in the course of ages, an extraordinary number of shells. In the case of 
      man, the shells generally occur in heaps, and there is reason to believe 
      that this character is long preserved. To distinguish the shells transported 
      by animals from those uplifted by the movement of the earth, the following 
      characters may be used :&mdash;Whether the shells had long lain dead under water, 
      as indicated by barnacles, serpulae, corallines adhering to their <em>insides 
     </em>; whether the shells, either from not being full grown or from their 
      kind, are too small for food; remembering that certain shells, as mussels, 
      may be unintentionally transported by man or other animals in their young 
      state adhering to larger shells; and lastly, whether all the specimens 
      have the same appearance of antiquity. Some shells, which have been exposed 
      for many ages, yet retain their colours in a surprising manner. The very 
      best evidence is afforded by bar-</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="33">[page] 198</p>
    <p>nacles and boring shells being found attached to or buried in the rock, 
      in the same positions in which they had lived; these may be sometimes found 
      by removing the earth or birds' dung covering points of rock. Where shells 
      are embedded in a superficial layer of soil, though it may appear exactly 
      like vegetable mould, specimens of it should be preserved, for the microscope 
      will sometimes reveal minute fragments of marine animals. In all these cases, 
      specimens of the shells, though broken and weathered, and having a wretched 
      appearance, must carefully be preserved; for a mere statement that such 
      upraised shells resembled those still living on the beach is absolutely 
      of no value. It should be noticed whether the proportional numbers between 
      the different kinds appear to be nearly the same in the upraised shells 
      and in those now cast on the beach. The height at which the marine remains 
      occur above the level of the sea should be measured. In confined situations 
      where the change of level appears to have been small, much caution must 
      be exercised in receiving any evidence; as a change in the direction of 
      the currents (resulting from alterations in neighbouring submarine banks) 
      may cause the tide to flow to a somewhat less height, and thus give the 
      appearance of the land having been upraised.</p>
    <p>Wherever a tract of country can be proved to have been recently elevated, 
      its surface, as exhibiting the late action of the sea, is a fertile field 
      for observation. On such coasts, terraces rising like steps, one above another, 
      often occur. Their outline and composition should be studied, diagrams made 
      of them, and their height measured at many and distant parts of the</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="34">[page] 199</p>
    <p>coast. There is reason to believe that in some instances such terraces
       range for surprisingly long distances at the same height. Where several
       occur on opposite sides of a valley a spirit level is almost indispensable,
       in order to recognize the corresponding stages. Where ranges of cliffs
      exist,  the marks of the erosion of the waves may sometimes be expected
      to occur,  and as these generally present a defined line, it is particularly
      desirable  that their horizontality should be ascertained by good levelling
      instruments,  and if not horizontal, that their inclination should be measured.
      Where  more than one zone of erosion can be detected all should be levelled,
      for  it does not necessarily follow that the several lines are parallel.
      Along  extensive coasts, and round islands which have been uplifted to
      a considerable  height, and where we now walk over what was, within a late
      geological period,  the bed of the sea, it would be well to observe whether
      extensive sedimentary  deposits have been upraised; for it has often been
      tacitly assumed that  sedimentary deposits are in process of formation
      on all coasts.</p>
    <p><em>Subsidence of the Land.&mdash;</em>This movement is more difficult to detect 
      than elevation, for it tends to hide under water the surface thus affected. 
      Evidence, therefore, of subsidence is very valuable; and this movement, 
      moreover, has probably played a more important part in the history of the 
      world than elevation, for there is reason to believe that most great formations 
      have been accumulated whilst the bed of the sea was sinking. Subsidence 
      may sometimes be inferred from the form of the coast-land; for instance, 
      where a line of cliffs, too irregular to have been formed by elevation alone, 
      plunges precipitously into a sea so profoundly</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="35">[page] 200</p>
    <p>deep that it cannot be supposed that the now deeply submerged portions 
      of the cliff have been simply worn away by the currents. The direct evidence 
      of subsidence, if not witnessed by man, is almost confined to the presence 
      of stumps of trees, peat-beds, and ruins of ancient buildings, partly submerged 
      on tidal beaches. Ancient buildings may sometimes afford such evidence in 
      unlikely situations: it has been asserted, that in one of the volcanic 
      islands in the Caroline archipelego there are ruins with the steps covered 
      by the sea. Again, at Terceira, at the Azores, there is an old church or 
      monastery said to be similarly circumstanced.</p>
    <p><em>Coral Reefs.*</em>&mdash;The most important point with respect to coral reefs,
       which can be investigated, is, the depth at which the bottom of the sea, 
      <em>outside the reef</em>, ceases to be covered with a continuous bed of
      living  corals. This can be ascertained by repeated soundings with a heavy
      and very  broad bell-shaped lead, armed with tallow, which will break off
      minute portions  of the corals or take an exact impression of them: it
      can thus also instantly  be seen how soon the bottom becomes covered with
      sand. This limit of depth  ought to be ascertained in different seas, under
      different latitudes, and  under different exposures. For collecting specimens
      of the corals, it is  to be feared that the dredge would become entangled,
      but chains and hooks  may be lowered for this purpose. There is reason
      to suspect that different  species of corals grow in different zones of
      depth; so that in collecting  specimens, the depth at which each kind
      is found, and at which it is most  abundant, should be carefully noted.
      It ought always</p>
    <p class="style2">* The only work specially written on this subject is 'The 
      Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs,' by Mr. Darwin.</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="36">[page] 201</p>
    <p>to be recorded whether the specimen came from the tranquil waters of a 
      lagoon or protected channel, or from the exposed outside of the reef. The 
      small reefs within the lagoons of certain atolls (or lagoon-islands) in 
      the Indian Ocean all rise to the surface; whereas in other atolls not a 
      single reef rises within several fathoms of the same level. It would be 
      a curious point to ascertain whether the corals in these cases consisted 
      of the same species; and if so, on what possible circumstance this singular 
      difference in the amount of their upward growth has depended.</p>
    <p>Any facts which can elucidate the rate at which corals can grow under favourable 
      circumstances, will ever be interesting: nor should negative facts, showing 
      that within a given period reefs have not increased either laterally or 
      vertically upwards, be neglected. In a full-grown forest, to judge of its 
      rate of growth, a part must be first cut down; so is it probably with reefs 
      of corals. The aborigines of some of the many coral islands in the great 
      oceans might perhaps adduce positive facts on this head; for instance, 
      the date might be known when a channel had been cut to float out a large 
      canoe, and which had since grown up.</p>
    <p>For the classification of coral reefs, the most important point to be attended 
      to, is the inclination of the bed of the adjoining sea; and, secondly, 
      the depth of the interior lagoon in the case of atolls, and of the channel 
      between the land and the reef, in Encircling or Barrier, and in Fringing 
      reefs. Whenever it is practicable, soundings ought to be taken at short 
      ascertained distances, from <em>close </em>to the breakers in a straight line 
      out to sea, so that a sectional outline might be protracted on paper. In 
      those cases in which the bottom</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="37">[page] 202</p>
    <p>descends by a set of ledges or steps, their form ought to be particularly 
      attended to; and whether they are covered with sand or by dead or living 
      coral; and whether the corals differ on the different ledges: the same 
      points should be attended to within the lagoon, wherever its bed or shore 
      is step-formed: the origin of these steps or ledges is at present obscure. 
      In the Indian and Pacific Oceans there are entire reefs, having the outline 
      of atolls or lagoon-islands lying several fathoms submerged; there are 
      likewise defined portions of reefs both in atolls and in encircling reefs 
      similarly submerged. It would be particularly desirable to. ascertain what 
      is the nature of these submerged surfaces, whether formed of sand or rock 
      or living or dead corals. In some cases two or more atolls are united by 
      a linear reef; the form of the bottom on each side of this connecting line 
      ought to be examined. Where two atolls or reef-encircled islands stand very 
      near each other, the depth between them might be attempted by deep soundings 
     : the bottom has been struck between some of the Maldiva atolls. Generally 
      the form and nature of the reefs encircling islands ought to be compared 
      in every respect with the annular reefs forming atolls.</p>
    <p>On the shores of every kind of reef, especially of atolls and of land encircled 
      by barrier reefs, evidence of the slow sinking of the land should be particularly 
      sought for; for instance, by stumps of trees, the foundation-posts of sheds, 
      by wells or graves or other works of art, now standing beneath the level 
      of high-water mark, and which there was good reason to believe must have 
      once stood above its level. The observer must bear in mind that cocoa-nut 
      trees and mangroves will grow in salt-water. If such evidence be found, 
      inquiry</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="38">[page] 203</p>
    <p>ought to be made whether earthquakes have been felt. On the other hand, 
      all masses of coral standing so much above the level of the sea that they 
      could not have been thrown up by the breakers during gales of wind, at a 
      period when the reef had not grown so far out seaward, should be investigated 
      and their height measured. There is reason to believe that some coral-reefs 
      have been thought to have been upraised, owing to the effect of the lateral 
      or horizontal extension of the reefs having been overlooked; for the necessary 
      result of this outward growth is gradually to break the force of the waves, 
      .so that the rocks, now further removed from the outer breakers, become 
      worn to a less height than formerly, and the more inland corals not being 
      any longer constantly washed by the surf, cease to live at a level at which 
      they once flourished. It is indispensable that specimens of all upraised 
      corals, and especially of the shells generally associated with them, should 
      be collected; for there can be no doubt that ancient strata containing 
      corals, have in some instances been confounded with recent coral-rock. The 
      importance of ascertaining whether coral-reefs have undergone, or are undergoing, 
      any change of level, depends on the belief that all the characteristic differences 
      between Atolls and Encircling reefs on the one hand, and Fringing reefs 
      on the other, depend on the effect produced on the upwardly-growing corals 
      by the slow sinking or rising of their foundations.</p>
    <p>A thick and widely-extended mass of upraised recent coral rock has never 
      yet been accurately examined, and a careful description of such a mass-especially 
      if the area included a central depression, showing that it originally existed 
      as an atoll-is a great desideratum.</p>
    <p dar:class="page" dar:pageseq="39">[page] 204</p>
    <p>Of what nature is the coral-rock; is it regularly stratified or crossed
       by oblique layers; does it consist of consolidated fine detritus or of
       coarse fragments, or is it formed of upright corals embedded as they grew?
      Are many shells or the bones of fish and turtle included in the mass, 
      and are the boring kinds still in their proper positions? The thickness
       of the entire mass and of the principal strata should be measured, and
      a  large suite of specimens collected.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In conclusion, it may be re-urged that the young geologist must bear in 
      mind, that to collect specimens is the least part of his labour. If he collect 
      fossils, he cannot go wrong; if he be so fortunate as to find the bones 
      of any of the higher animals, he will, in all probability, make an important 
      discovery. Let him, however, remember that he will add greatly to the value 
      of his fossils by labelling every single specimen, by never mingling those 
      from two formations, and by describing the succession of the strata whence 
      they are disinterred. But let his aim be higher: by making sectional diagrams 
      as accurately as possible of every district which he visits (nor let him 
      suppose that accuracy is a quality to be acquired at will), by collecting 
      for his own use, and carefully examining numerous rock-specimens, and by 
      acquiring the habit of patiently seeking the cause of everything which meets 
      his eye, and by comparing it with all that he has himself seen or read of, 
      he will, even if without any previous knowledge, in a short time infallibly 
      become a good geologist, and as certainly will he enjoy the high satisfaction 
      of contributing to the perfection of the history of this wonderful world.</p>
