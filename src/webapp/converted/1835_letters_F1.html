    <p align="right">RIO DE JANEIRO, <em>May</em> 18, 1832.</p>
    <p>WE started from Plymouth on the 27th December 1831—At St Jago (Cape 
      de Verd Islands) we spent three weeks. The geology was pre-eminently interesting, 
      and I believe quite new: there are some facts on a large scale, of upraised 
      coast that would interest Mr. Lyell. . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>St Jago is singularly barren, and produces few plants or insects; so that 
      my hammer was my usual companion. . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>On the coast I collected many marine animals, chiefly gasteropodous mollusca 
      (I think some new). I examined pretty accurately a Caryophyllia, and, if 
      my eyes were not bewitched, former descriptions have </p>
    <p dar:class="page">[page] 4</p>
    <p>not the slightest resemblance to the animal. I took several specimens of 
      an Octopus, which possessed a most marvellous power of changing its colours; 
      equalling any chamelion, and evidently accommodating the changes to the 
      colour of the ground which it passed over. . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>We then sailed for Bahia, and touched at the rock of St Paul. This is a 
      serpentine formation. . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>After touching at the Abrothos, we arrived here on April 4th.. . . . . 
      . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>A few days after arriving, I started on an expedition of one hundred and 
      fifty miles to Rio Macao, which lasted eighteen days. . . . . . . . . . 
      .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>I am now collecting fresh water and land animals: if what was told me in 
      London is true, viz. that there are no small insects in the collections 
      from the Tropics, I tell entomologists to look out and have their pens ready 
      for describing. I have taken as minute (if not more so) as in England, Hydorpori, 
      Hygroti, Hydrobii, Pselaphi, Staphylini, Curculiones, Bembidia, &amp;c. 
      &amp;c. It is exceedingly interesting to observe the difference of genera 
      and species from those which I know; it is however much less than I had 
      expected. . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p dar:class="page">[page] 5</p>
    <p>I have just returned from a walk, and as a specimen how little the insects 
      are known, Noterus, according to Dic. Class. consists solely of three European 
      species. I, in one haul of my net, took five distinct species. . . . . . 
      . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>At Bahia, the pegmatite and gneiss in beds had the same direction as was 
      observed by Humboldt to prevail over Columbia, distant thirteen hundred 
      miles.</p>
    <p align="center">_____________ </p>
    <p align="right">MONTE VIDEO, <em>Aug</em>. 15, 1832.</p>
    <p>MY collection of plants from the Abrothos is interesting, as I suspect 
      it contains nearly the whole flowering vegetation. . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>I made an enormous collection of Arachnidæ at Rio. Also a good many 
      small beetles in pill-boxes: but it is not the best time of year for the 
      latter. . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>Amongst the lower animals, nothing has so much interested me as finding 
      two species of elegantly coloured planariæ (?) inhabiting the dry 
      forest! The false relation they bear to snails is the most extraordinary 
      thing of the kind I have ever seen. In the same genus (or more truly, family) 
      some of the marine species possess an organization so</p>
    <p dar:class="page">[page] 6</p>
    <p>marvellous, that I can scarcely credit my eyesight. Every one has heard 
      of the discoloured streaks of water in the equatorial regions. One I examined 
      was owing to the presence of such minute Oscillatoria, that in each square 
      inch of surface there must have been at least one hundred thousand present. 
      . . . . . . . . . . </p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>I might collect a far greater number of specimens of invertebrate animals 
      if I took up less time over each: but I have come to the conclusion, that 
      two animals with their original colour and shape noted down, will be more 
      valuable to naturalists than six with only dates and place. . . . . . . 
      . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>At this present minute we are at anchor in the mouth of the river: and 
      such a strange scene it is. Every thing is in flames—the sky with 
      lightning—the water with luminous particles—and even the very 
      masts are pointed with a blue flame.</p>

    <p align="right">MONTE VIDEO, <em>Nov</em>. 24, 1832.</p>
    <p>WE arrived here on the 24th of October, after our first cruize on the coast 
      of Patagonia, north of the Rio Negro. . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p dar:class="page">[page] 7</p>
    <p>I had hoped for the credit of dame Nature, no such country as this last 
      existed; in sad reality we coasted along two hundred and forty miles of 
      sand hillocks; I never knew before, what a horrid ugly object a sand hillock 
      is: the famed country of the Rio Plata in my opinion is not much better; 
      an enormous brackish river bounded by an interminable green plain is enough 
      to make any naturalist groan. . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>I have been very lucky with fossil bones; I have many fragments of at least 
      six distinct animals; as many of these are teeth, shattered and rolled as 
      they have been, I trust they will be recognized. I have paid all the attention 
      I am capable of, to their geological site; but of course it is too long 
      a story for a letter. 1st. the tarsi and meta-tarsi, very perfect, of a 
      cavia; 2d. the upper jaw and head of some very large animal, with four square 
      hollow molars, and the head greatly produced in front. I at first thought 
      it belonged either to the megalonyx or megatherium. In confirmation of this, 
      in the same formation, I found a large surface of the osseous polygonal 
      plates, which &quot;late observations&quot; (what are they?) have shewn 
      to belong to the megatherium. Immediately I saw them I thought they must 
      belong to an enormous armadillo, living species of which genus are so abundant 
      here. 3d. The lower jaw of some large animal, which, from the molar teeth 
      I should think belonged to the edentata; 4th. large molar teeth, which in 
      some</p>
    <p dar:class="page">[page] 8</p>
    <p>respects would seem to belong to some enormous species of rodentia; 5th. 
      also some smaller teeth belonging to the same order, &amp;c. &amp;c.—They 
      are mingled with marine shells, which appear to me identical with existing 
      species. But since they were deposited in their beds, several geological 
      changes have taken place in the country. . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>There is a poor specimen of a bird, which to my unornithological eyes, 
      appears to be a happy mixture of a lark, pigeon, and snipe. Mr Mac Leay 
      himself never imagined such an inosculating creature.</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>I have taken some interesting amphibia; a fine bipes; a new Trigonocephalus, 
      in its habits beautifully connecting Crotalus and Viperus: and plenty of 
      new (as far as my knowledge goes) saurians. As for one little toad, I hope 
      it may be new, that it may be christened &quot;diabolicus.&quot; Milton 
      must allude to this very individual, when he talks of &quot;squat like a 
      toad.&quot;. . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>Amongst the pelagic crustaceæ, some new and curious genera. Among 
      Zoophites some interesting animals. As for one Flustra, if I had not the 
      specimen to back me, nobody would believe in its most anomalous structure. 
      But as for novelty, all this is nothing to a family of pelagic animals, 
      which at first sight appear like Medusa, but are really highly organized.</p>
    <p dar:class="page">[page] 9</p>
    <p> I have examined them repeatedly, and certainly from their structure it 
      would be impossible to place them in any existing order. Perhaps Salpa is 
      the nearest animal; although the transparency of the body is almost the 
      only character they have in common.. . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>We have been at Buenos Ayres for a week. It is a fine large city; but such 
      a country; every thing is mud; you can go no where, you can do nothing for 
      mud. In the city I obtained much information about the banks of the Uruguay. 
      I hear of limestone with shells, and beds of shells in every direction.</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>I purchased fragments of some enormous bones, which I was assured belonged 
      to the former giants!!</p>
    <p align="center">_________________ </p>
    <p align="right"><em>April</em> 11, 1833.</p>
    <p>WE are now running up from the Falkland Islands to the Rio Negro (or Colorado.). 
      . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>It is now some months since we have been at a civilized port; nearly all 
      this time has been spent in the most southern part of Tierra del Fuego. 
      It is a detestable place; gales succeed gales at such short intervals, that 
      it is difficult to do any thing. We were twenty-three days off Cape Horn, 
      and could</p>
    <p dar:class="page">[page] 10</p>
    <p> by no means get to the westward.—We at last ran into harbour, and 
      in the boats got to the west of the inland channels.—With two boats 
      we went about three hundred miles; and thus I had an excellent opportunity 
      of geologizing and seeing much of the savages. The Fuegians are in a more 
      miserable state of barbarism than I had expected ever to have seen a human 
      being. In this inclement country they are absolutely naked, and their temporary 
      houses are like those which children make in summer with boughs of trees.. 
      . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>The climate in some respects is a curious mixture of severity and mildness; 
      as far as regards the animal kingdom the former character prevails; I have 
      in consequence not added much to my collections. The geology of this part 
      of Tierra del Fuego was to me very interesting. The country is non-fossiliferous, 
      and a common-place succession of granitic rocks and slates: attempting to 
      make out the relation of cleavage, strata, &amp;c. &amp;c. was my chief 
      amusement.. . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>The Southern ocean is nearly as sterile as the continent it washes. Crustaceæ 
      have afforded me most work.</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>I found a Zoea, of most curious form, its body being only one-sixth the 
      length of the two spears. I am convinced, from its structure and other reasons, 
      it is</p>
    <p dar:class="page">[page] 11</p>
    <p> a young Erichthus. I must mention part of the structure of a Decapod, 
      it is so very anomalous: the last pair of legs are small and dorsal, but 
      instead of being terminated by a claw, as in all others, it has three curved 
      bristle-like appendages; these are finely serrated and furnished with cups, 
      somewhat resembling those of the Cephalopods. The animal being pelagic, 
      this beautiful structure enables it to hold on to light floating objects. 
      I have found out something about the propagation of that ambiguous tribe 
      the Corallines.. . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>After leaving Tierra del Fuego, we sailed to the Falklands.. . . . . . 
      . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>I had here the high good fortune to find amongst the most primitive looking 
      rocks, a bed of micaceous sandstone, abounding with Terebratula and its 
      sub-genera, and Entrochites. As this is so remote a locality from Europe, 
      I think the comparison of these impressions with those of the oldest fossiliferous 
      rocks of Europe will be pre-eminently interesting. Of course they are only 
      models and casts; but many of them are very perfect. </p>
    <p align="center">________________ </p>
    <p align="right">RIO DE LA PLATA, <em>July</em> 18, 1833.</p>
    <p>THE greater part of the winter has been passed in this river at Meldonado.. 
      . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p dar:class="page">[page] 12</p>
    <p>We have got almost every bird in this neighbourhood, (Meldonado) about 
      eighty in number, and nearly twenty quadrupeds.. . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>In a few days we go to the Rio Negro to survey some banks.. . . . . . . 
      . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>The geology must be very interesting. It is near the junction of the Megatherium 
      and Patagonian cliffs. From what I saw of the latter, in one half hour, 
      in St Joseph's bay, they would be well worth a long examination. Above the 
      great oyster-bed there is one of gravel, which fills up inequalities in 
      its interior; and above this, and therefore high out of the water, is one 
      of such modern shells that they retain their colour and emit a bad smell 
      when burnt. Patagonia must clearly have lately risen from the water.</p>
    <p align="center">________________ </p>
    <p align="right">MONTE VIDEO, <em>November</em> 12, 1833.</p>
    <p>I LEFT the Beagle at the Rio Negro, and crossed by land to Buenos Ayres. 
      There is now carrying on a bloody war of extermination against the Indians, 
      by which I was able to make this passage. But at the best it is sufficiently 
      dangerous, and till now very rarely travelled. It is the most wild, dreary 
      plain imaginable, without settled inhabitant or head of</p>
    <p dar:class="page">[page] 13</p>
    <p>cattle. There are military &quot;postas&quot; at wide intervals, by which 
      means I travelled. We lived for many days on deer and ostriches, and had 
      to sleep in the open camp.. . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>I had the satisfaction of ascending the Tierra de la Ventana, a chain of 
      mountains between three and four thousand feet high, the very existence 
      of which is scarcely known beyond the Rio Plata. After resting a week at 
      Buenos Ayres, I started for St Fé. On the road the geology was interesting. 
      I found two great groups of immense bones, but so very soft as to render 
      it impossible to remove them. I think, from a fragment of one of the teeth, 
      they belonged to the Mastodon. In the Rio Carcarana, I got a tooth which 
      puzzles even my conjectures. It looks like an enormous gnawing one. At St 
      Fé, not being well, I embarked and had a fine sail of three hundred 
      miles down that princely river the Parana. When I returned to Buenos Ayres, 
      I found the country upside down with revolutions, which caused me much trouble. 
      I at last got away and joined the Beagle. </p>
    <p align="center">________________ </p>
    <p align="right">E. FALKLAND ISLAND, <em>March</em>, 1834.</p>
    <p>I HAVE been alarmed by your expression &quot;cleaning all the bones,&quot; 
      as I am afraid the printed numbers will be lost: the reason I am so anxious 
      they should</p>
    <p dar:class="page">[page] 14</p>
    <p>not be, is, that a part were found in a gravel with recent shells, but 
      others in a very different bed. Now with these latter there were bones of 
      an Agouti, a genus of animals, I believe, peculiar to America, and it would 
      be curious to prove that some one of the same genus coexisted with the megatherium; 
      such, and many other points entirely depend on the numbers being carefully 
      preserved.. . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>I collected all the plants which were in flower on the coast of Patagonia, 
      at Port Desire, and St Julian; also on the eastern parts of Tierra del Fuego, 
      where the climate and features of Tierra del Fuego and Patagonia are united.. 
      . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>The soil of Patagonia is very dry, gravelly, and light. In East Tierra, 
      it is gravelly, peaty, and damp. Since leaving the Rio Plata I have had 
      some opportunities of examining the great southern Patagonian formation. 
      I have a good many shells; from the little I know of the subject, it must 
      be a tertiary formation, for some of the shells (and corallines) now exist 
      in the sea. Others, I believe, do not. This bed, which is chiefly characterized 
      by a great oyster, is covered by a very curious bed of porphyry pebbles, 
      which I have traced for more than seven hundred miles. But the most curious 
      fact is, that the whole of the east coast of the southern part of South 
      America has been elevated from the ocean, since a period during which</p>
    <p dar:class="page">[page] 15</p>
    <p>muscles have not lost their blue colour. At Port St Julian I found some 
      very perfect bones of some large animal, I fancy a Mastodon: the bones of 
      one hind extremity are very perfect and solid. This is interesting, as the 
      latitude is between 49° and 50°, and the site far removed from the 
      great Pampas, where bones of the narrow toothed Mastodon are so frequently 
      found. By the way this Mastodon and the Megatherium, I have no doubt, were 
      fellow brethren in the ancient plains. Relics of the Megatherium I have 
      found at a distance of nearly six hundred miles in a north and south line. 
      In Tierra del Fuego I have been interested in finding some sort of ammonite 
      (also I believe found by Capt. King) in the slate near Port Famine; and 
      on the eastern coast there are some curious alluvial plains, by which the 
      existence of certain quadrupeds in the islands can clearly be accounted 
      for. There is a sandstone with the impression of leaves like the common 
      beech tree; also modern shells, &amp;c., and on the surface of the table 
      land there are, as usual, muscles with their blue colour, &amp;c.. . . . 
      . . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>I have chiefly been employed in preparing myself for the South Sea, and 
      examining the polypi of the smaller corallines in these latitudes. Many 
      in themselves are very curious, and I think undescribed: there was one appalling 
      one, allied to a Flustra, which I dare say I mentioned having found to the 
      northward, where</p>
    <p dar:class="page">[page] 16</p>
    <p> the cells have a moveable organ (like a vulture's head, with a dilatable 
      beak), fixed on the edge. But what is of more general interest, is the unquestionable 
      (as it appears to me) existence of another species of ostrich besides the 
      Struthio ostrea. All the Gauchos and Indians state it is the case: and I 
      place the greatest faith in their observations. I have the head, neck, and 
      piece of skin, feathers, and legs of one. The differences are chiefly in

    <p>AFTER leaving the Falklands, we proceeded to the Rio Santa Cruz; followed 
      up the river till within twenty miles of the Cordilleras: unfortunately 
      want of provisions compelled us to return. This expedition was most important 
      to me, as it was a transverse section of the great Patagonian formation. 
      I conjecture (an accurate examination of the fossils may possibly determine 
      the point) that the main bed is somewhere about the meiocene period (using 
      Mr Lyell's expression); judging from what I have seen of the present shells 
      of Patagonia. This bed contains an enormous mass of lava. This is of some</p>
    <p dar:class="page">[page] 17</p>
    <p> interest, as being a rude approximation to the age of the volcanic part 
      of the great range of the Andes. Long before this it existed as a slate 
      and porphyritic line of hills. I have collected a tolerable quantity of 
      information respecting the various periods and forms of elevations of these 
      plains. I think these will be interesting to Mr Lyell. I had deferred reading 
      his third volume till my return; you may guess how much pleasure it gave 
      me; some of his wood-cuts came so exactly into play, that I have only to 
      refer to them, instead of redrawing similar ones.. . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>The valley of Santa Cruz appears to me a very curious one; at first it 
      quite baffled me. I believe I can shew good reasons for supposing it to 
      have been once a northern strait, like that of Magellan.. . . . . . . . 
      . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>In Tierra del Fuego I collected and examined some corallines: I have observed 
      one fact which quite startled me. It is, that in the genus Sertularia (taken 
      in its most restricted form as by Lamouroux), and in two species which, 
      excluding comparative expressions, I should find much difficulty in describing 
      as different, the polypi quite and essentially differed in all their most 
      important and evident parts of structure. I have already seen enough to 
      be convinced that the present families of corallines, as arranged by Lamarck, 
      Cuvier, &amp;c. are highly artificial. It appears to me, that they are in 
      the same</p>
    <p dar:class="page">[page] 18</p>
    <p>state in which shells were, when Linnæus left them for Cuvier to 
      re-arrange.. . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>It is most extraordinary I can no where see in my books a single description 
      of the polypus of any one coral (excepting Lobularia (Alcyonium) of Savigny). 
      I found a curious little stony Cellaria (a new genus), each cell provided 
      with a long toothed bristle capable of various and rapid motions. This motion 
      is often simultaneous, and can be produced by irritation. This fact, as 
      far as I see, is quite isolated in the history (excepting of the Flustra, 
      with an organ like a vulture's head) of Zoophites. It points out a much 
      more intimate relation between the polypi, than Lamarck is willing to allow. 
      I forget whether I mentioned having seen something of the manner of propagation 
      in that most ambiguous family, the corallines: I feel pretty well convinced 
      that if they are not plants, they are not Zoophites: the &quot;gemmule&quot; 
      of a Halimeda contains several articulations united, ready to burst their 
      envelope and become attached to some basis. I believe that in Zoophites 
      universally, the gemmule produces a single polypus, which afterwards or 
      at the same time grows with its cell, or single articulation. The Beagle 
      left the strait of Magellan in the middle of winter: she found her road 
      out by a wild unfrequented channel; well might Sir J. Nasborough call the 
      west coast South Desolation, &quot;because it is so desolate a land</p>
    <p dar:class="page">[page] 19</p>
    <p>to behold.&quot; We were driven into Chiloe, by some very bad weather. 
      An Englishman gave me three specimens of that very fine lucanoidal insect, 
      which is described in the Cambridge Philosophical Transactions, two males 
      and one female. I find Chiloe is composed of lava and recent deposits. The 
      lavas are curious, from abounding with or rather being composed of pitchstone.. 
      . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>We arrived here the day before yesterday; the views of the distant mountains 
      are most sublime and the climate delightful: after our long cruise in the 
      damp gloomy climates of the South, to breathe a clear dry air, and feel 
      honest warm sunshine, and eat good fresh roast beef, must be the summum 
      bonum of human life. I do not like the looks of the rocks half so much as 
      the beef, there is too much of those rather insipid ingredients, mica, quartz, 
      and feldspar.. . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>Shortly after arriving here I set out on a geological excursion, and had 
      a very pleasant ramble about the base of the Andes. The whole country appears 
      composed of breccias, (and I imagine slates) which universally have been 
      modified, and often completely altered by the action of fire; the varieties 
      of porphyry thus produced are endless, but no where have I yet met with 
      rocks which have flowed in a stream; dykes of greenstone are very numerous. 
      Modern volcanic action is entirely shut up in the</p>
    <p dar:class="page">[page] 20</p>
    <p> very central parts (which cannot now be reached on account of the snow) 
      of the Cordilleras. To the south of the Rio Maypo, I examined the tertiary 
      plains already partially described by M. Gay. The fossil shells appear to 
      me to differ more widely from the recent ones, then in the great Patagonian 
      formation; it will be curious if an eocene and meiocene formation (recent 
      there is abundance of) could be proved to exist in South America as well 
      as in Europe. I have been much interested by finding abundance of recent 
      shells at an elevation of thirteen hundred feet; the country in many places 
      is scattered over with shells, but these are all <em>littoral</em> ones! 
      So that I suppose the thirteen hundred feet elevation must be owing to a 
      succession of small elevations, such as in 1822. With these certain proofs 
      of the recent residence of the ocean over all the lower parts of Chili, 
      the outline of every view and the form of each valley possesses a high interest. 
      Has the action of running water or the sea formed this ravine? was a question 
      which often arose in my mind, and was generally answered by my finding a 
      bed of recent shells at the bottom. I have not sufficient arguments, but 
      I do not believe that more than a small fraction of the height of the Andes 
      has been formed within the tertiary period.</p>

    <p align="right">VALPARAISO, <em>March</em> 1835.</p>
    <p>WE are now lying becalmed off Valparaiso, and I will take the opportunity 
      of writing a few lines to you. The termination of our voyage is at last 
      decided on. We leave the coast of America in the beginning of September, 
      and hope to reach England in the same month of 1836. . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>You will have heard an account of the dreadful earthquake of the 20th of 
      February. I wish some of the geologists, who think the earthquakes of these 
      times are trifling, could see the way in which the solid rock is shivered. 
      In the town there is not one house habitable; the ruins remind me of the 
      drawings of the desolated eastern cities. We were at Valdivia at the time, 
      and felt the shock very severely. The sensation was like that of skating 
      over very thin ice; that is, distinct undulations were perceptible. The 
      whole scene of Concepcion and Talcuana is one of the most interesting spectacles 
      we have beheld since leaving England. Since leaving Valparaiso, during this 
      cruise, I have done little excepting in geology. In the modern tertiary 
      strata I have examined four bands of disturbance, which reminded me on a 
      small scale of the famous tract in the Isle of Wight. In one spot there 
      were beautiful examples of three different forms of upheaval. In two cases 
      I think I can show that the inclination is owing to the presence</p>
    <p dar:class="page">[page] 22</p>
    <p> of a system of parallel dykes traversing the inferior mica slate. The 
      whole of the coast from Chiloe to the south extreme of the Peninsula of 
      Tres Montes is composed of the latter rock; it is traversed by very numerous 
      dykes, the mineralogical nature of which will, I suspect, turn out very 
      curious. I examined one grand transverse chain of granite, which has clearly 
      burst up through the overlying slate. At the Peninsula of Tres Montes there 
      has been an old volcanic focus, which corresponds to another in the north 
      part of Chiloe. I was much pleased at Chiloe by finding a thick bed of recent 
      oyster-shells, &amp;c. capping the tertiary plain, out of which grew large 
      forest trees. I can now prove that both sides of the Andes have risen in 
      this recent period to a considerable height. Here the shells were three 
      hundred and fifty feet above the sea. In Zoology I have done but very little; 
      excepting a large collection of minute diptera and hymenoptera from Chiloe. 
      I took in one day, Pselaphus, Anaspis, Latridius, Leiodes, Cercyon, and 
      Elmis, and two beautiful true Carabi; I might have fancied myself collecting 
      in England. A new and pretty genus of nudibranch mollusca which cannot crawl 
      on a flat surface, and a genus in the family of balanidæ, which has 
      not a true case, but lives in minute cavities in the shells of the concholepas, 
      are nearly the only two novelties.</p>

    <p align="right">VALPARAISO, <em>April</em> 18, 1835.</p>
    <p>I HAVE just returned from Mendoza, having crossed the Cordilleras by two 
      passes. This trip has added much to my knowledge of the geology of the country. 
      . . . . . . . . . . </p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>I will give a very short sketch of the structure of these huge mountains. 
      In the Portillo pass (the more southern one) travellers have described the 
      Cordilleras to consist of a double chain of nearly equal altitude, separated 
      by a considerable interval. This is the case: and the same structure extends 
      northward to Uspellata. The little elevation of the eastern line (here not 
      more than six thousand or seven thousand feet) has caused it almost to be 
      overlooked. To begin with the western and principal chain, where the sections 
      are best seen; we have an enormous mass of a porphyritic conglomerate resting 
      on granite. This latter rock seems to form the nucleus of the whole mass, 
      and is seen in the deep lateral valleys, injected amongst, upheaving, overturning 
      in the most extraordinary manner, the overlying strata. On the bare sides 
      of the mountains, the complicated dykes and wedges of variously coloured 
      rocks, are seen traversing in every possible form and shape the same formations, 
      which, by their intersections, prove a succession of violences. The stratification 
      in all the mountains is beautifully distinct, and owing to a variety in 
      their colouring, can be seen at great</p>
    <p dar:class="page">[page] 24</p>
    <p>distances. I cannot imagine any part of the world presenting a more extraordinary 
      scene of the breaking up of the crust of the globe, than these central peaks 
      of the Andes. The upheaval has taken place by a great number of (nearly) 
      north and south lines*; which in most cases has formed as many anticlinal 
      and synclinal ravines. The strata in the highest pinnacles are almost universally 
      inclined at an angle from 70° to 80°. I cannot tell you how much 
      I enjoyed some of these views; it is worth coming from England, once to 
      feel such intense delight. At an elevation of from ten to twelve thousand 
      feet, there is a transparency in the air, and a confusion of distances, 
      and a sort on stillness, which give the sensation of being in another world; 
      and when to this is joined the picture so plainly drawn of the great epochs 
      of violence, it causes in the mind a most strange assemblage of ideas. The 
      formation which I call porphyritic conglomerates, is the most important 
      and most developed in Chili. From a great number of sections, I find it 
      to be a true coarse conglomerate or breccia, which passes by every step, 
      in slow gradation, into a fine clay-stone porphyry; the pebbles and cement 
      becoming porphyritic, till at last all is blended in one compact rock. The 
      porphyries are excessively abundant in this chain, and I feel sure that 
      at least four-fifths of them have been thus</p>
    <p align="center" class="style2">* Of dykes?</p>
    <p dar:class="page">[page] 25</p>
    <p>produced from sedimentary beds in situ. There are also porphyries which 
      have been injected from below amongst the strata, and others ejected which 
      have flowed in streams: and I could shew specimens of this rock, produced 
      in these three methods, which cannot be distinguished. It is a great mistake 
      to consider the Cordilleras (here) as composed only of rocks which have 
      flowed in streams. In this range I nowhere saw a fragment which I believe 
      to have thus originated, although the road passes at no great distance from 
      the active volcanos. The porphyries, conglomerates, sandstone, quartzone-sandstone, 
      and limestones alternate and pass into each other many times (overlying 
      clay-slate, when not broken through by the granite.) In the upper parts 
      the sandstone begins to alternate with gypsum, till at last we have this 
      substance of a stupendous thickness. I really think the formation is in 
      some places (it varies much) nearly two thousand feet thick. It occurs often 
      with a green (Epidote?) siliceous sandstone and snow-white marble: and resembles 
      that found in the Alps, from containing large concretions of a crystalline 
      marble of a blackish-gray colour. The upper beds, which form some of the 
      higher pinnacles, consist of layers of snow-white gypsum and red compact 
      sandstone, from the thickness of paper to a few feet, alternating in an 
      endless round. The rock has a most curiously painted appearance. At the 
      pass of the Puquenas in this formation, where a black rock (like clay-slate,</p>
    <p dar:class="page">[page] 26</p>
    <p> without many laminæ) and pale limestone have replaced the red sandstone, 
      I found abundant impressions of shells. The elevation must be between twelve 
      thousand and thirteen thousand feet. A shell which I believe is a Gryphæa 
      is the most abundant. There is also an Ostrea, Turritella, Ammonites, small 
      bivalve, Terebratula (?) Perhaps some good conchologist will be able to 
      give a guess to what grand division of the continents of Europe these organic 
      remains bear most resemblance. They are exceedingly imperfect and few; the 
      Gryphites are most perfect. It was late in the season, and the situation 
      particularly dangerous, from snow-storms. I did not dare to delay, otherwise 
      a good harvest might have been reaped. So much for the western line. In 
      the Portillo Pass, proceeding eastward, I met with an immense mass of a 
      conglomerate, dipping to the west 45°, which rests on micaceous sandstone,&amp;c. 
      upheaved, converted into quartz rock, penetrated by dykes, from a very grand 
      mass of <em>protogene</em> (large crystals of quartz, red feldspar, and 
      a little chlorite.) Now this conglomerate, which reposes on and dips from 
      the protogene at an angle of 45°, consists of the peculiar rocks of 
      the first described chain, <em>pebbles</em> of the black rock with shells, 
      green sandstone, <em>&amp;c</em>. &amp;c. It is here manifest also, that 
      the upheaval (and deposition at least of part) of the grand eastern chain 
      is entirely posterior to the western. To the north, in the Uspellata pass, 
      we have also a fact of the same</p>
    <p dar:class="page">[page] 27</p>
    <p>class. Bear this in mind; it will help to make you believe what follows. 
      I have said the Uspellata range is geologically, although only six thousand 
      or seven thousand feet, a continuation of the grand eastern chain. It has 
      its nucleus of granite, consisting of grand beds of various crystalline 
      rocks, which I can feel no doubt are subaqueous lavas alternating with sandstone, 
      conglomerates, and white aluminous beds (like decomposed feldspar) with 
      many other curious varieties of sedimentary deposits. These lavas and sandstones 
      alternate very many times, and are quite conformable one to the other. During 
      two days of careful examination I said to myself at least fifty times, how 
      exactly like, only rather harder, these beds are to those of the upper tertiary 
      strata of Patagonia, Chiloe, and Concepcion, without the possibility of 
      their identity ever having occurred to me. At last there was no resisting 
      the conclusion. I could not expect shells, for they never occur in this 
      formation; but lignite or carbonaceous shale ought to be found. I had previously 
      been exceedingly puzzled by meeting in the sandstone with thin layers (a 
      few inches to some feet thick) of a brecciated pitchstone. I now strongly 
      suspect that the underlying granite has altered such beds into this pitchstone. 
      The silicified wood (particularly characteristic of the formation) was yet 
      absent; but the conviction that I was on the tertiary strata was so strong 
      in my mind by this time, that on the third day, in the midst of lavas, and 
      heaps of</p>
    <p dar:class="page">[page] 28</p>
    <p> granite, I began an apparently forlorn hunt in search of it. How do you 
      think I succeeded? In an escarpement of compact greenish sandstone I found 
      a small wood of petrified trees in a vertical position, or rather the strata 
      were inclined about 20° or 30° to one point, and the trees 70° 
      to the opposite; that is, they were before the tilt truly vertical. The 
      sandstone consists of many horizontal layers, and is marked by the concentric 
      lines of the bark (I have a specimen). Eleven are perfectly silicified, 
      and resemble the dicotyledonous wood which I found at Chiloe and Concepcion: 
      the others, thirty to thirty-four in number, I only know to be trees from 
      the analogy of form and position; they consist of snow-white columns (Like 
      Lot's wife) of coarsely crystalized carbonate of lime. The largest shaft 
      is seven feet. They are all close together, within one hundred yards, and 
      about the same level; no where else could I find any. It cannot be doubted 
      that the layers of fine sandstone have quietly been deposited between a 
      clump of trees, which were fixed by their roots. The sandstone rests on 
      lava, is covered by a great bed, apparently about one thousand feet thick, 
      of black augitic lava, and over this there are at least five grand alternations 
      of such rocks and aqueous sedimentary deposits; amounting in thickness to 
      several thousand feet. I am quite afraid of the only conclusion which I 
      can draw from this fact, namely, that there must have been a depression 
      in the surface of the land to that amount. But</p>
    <p dar:class="page">[page] 29</p>
    <p>neglecting this consideration, it was a most satisfactory support of my 
      presumption of the tertiary age of this eastern chain. (I mean by tertiary, 
      that the shells of the period were closely allied to, and some identical 
      with, those which now lie in the lower beds of Patagonia.) A great part 
      of the proof must remain upon my ipse dixit of a mineralogical resemblance 
      to those beds whose age is known. According to this view granite, which 
      forms peaks of a height probably of fourteen thousand feet, has been fluid 
      in the tertiary period: strata of that period have been altered by its heat, 
      and are traversed by dykes from the mass: are now inclined at high angles, 
      and form regular or complicated anticlinal lines. To complete this climax, 
      these same sedimentary strata and lavas are traversed by very numerous true 
      metallic veins of iron, copper, arsenic, silver, and gold, and these can 
      be traced to the underlying granite. A gold mine has been worked close to 
      the clump of silicified trees. When you see my specimens, sections, and 
      account, you will think there is pretty strong presumptive evidence of the 
      above facts. They appear very important; for the structure and size of this 
      chain will bear comparison with any in the world: and that all this should 
      have been produced in so very recent a period is indeed remarkable. In my 
      own mind I am quite convinced of it. I can any how most conscientiously 
      say, that no previously formed conjecture warped my judgment. As I have 
      described, so did I actually</p>
    <p dar:class="page">[page] 30</p>
    <p>observe the facts. . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p align="center"> . . . . . . . . . .</p>
    <p>On some of the large patches of perpetual snow, I found the famous red

    <p>I also send a small bottle with two Lizards: one of them is viviparous, 
      as you will see by the accompanying notice. M. Gay, a French naturalist, 
      has already published in one of the newspapers of this country a similar 
      statement, and probably has forwarded to Paris some account*</p>
    <p class="style2">* The following is an Extract from the Newspaper referred 
      to by MR DARWIN:</p>
    <p class="style2">&quot;Besides these labours I employed myself during the 
      great rains in dissecting various reptiles. It must be interesting to know 
      the influence of the climate of Valdivia on the animals of this family. 
      In the greater part of those which I have been able to submit to my scalpel, 
      I have found a truly extraordinary fact, that they were viviparous. Not 
      only the innocent Snake of Valdivia has offered to my notice this singular 
      phenomenon, but also a beautiful and new kind of Iguana which approaches 
      very near to the Liposoma of Spix, and to which, on account of its beautiful 
      colours, he has given the name of Chrysosaurus. All the species, even those 
      which lay eggs in Santiago, here produce their young alive; and the same 
      thing happens with some Batrachians, and particularly with a genus near 
      to the Rhinella of Fitzingen, of which the numerous species have the skin 
      pleasingly spotted with green, yellow, and black. I need not dwell on the 
      importance of this last example, in reference to comparative anatomy: an 
      importance which appeared to me still greater when, on analyzing a Tadpole 
      not yet transformed, I satisfied myself that nature has not varied </p>
    <p dar:class="page">[page] 31</p>
    <p>In the box there are two bags of seeds, one ticketed &quot;valleys of Cordilleras 
      five thousand to ten thousand feet high&quot;: the soil and climate exceedingly 
      dry; soil light and strong; extremes in temperature: the other &quot;chiefly 
      from the dry sandy traversia of Mendoza, three thousand feet, more or less.&quot; 
      If some of the bushes should grow, but not be healthy, try a slight sprinkling 
      of salt and saltpetre. The plain is saliferous. . . . . . . . . . .</p>

      any habitation could ever have existed, owing to the absence of water. Amongst 
      the Chonos dried plants, you will see a fine specimen of the wild potatoe, 
      growing under a most opposite climate, and unquestionably a true wild potatoe. 
      It must be a distinct species from that of the lower Cordilleras.</p>

      live in water, the intestines were of a length very disproportioned to the 
      body: now if this length were necessary to the latter, which live upon vegetable 
      substances, it was altogether useless to those which are to undergo their 
      metamorphosis in the belly of the mother: and thus nature has followed the 
      march prescribed to her by a uniformity of construction, and without deviating 
      from it, has admitted a simple exception, a real hiatus, well worthy the 
  attention of the philosophical naturalist.</p>
