<p><em>Darwin Online </em> is hosted by the Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities  and a particular debt of gratitude is owed to  Ludmilla Jordanova, Mary Jacobus, Catherine Hurley,  Melanie Leggatt, Gemma Tyler, Michele Maciejewska, Catherine Schneider and Philippa Smith. A  debt of thanks is owed to Stuart Williams who made an interim set of navigation buttons. </p>
<p>Over several years Randal Keynes (Darwin's great, great grandson) has provided particularly valuable encouragement, support and advice at many levels as well as contributing to the site. Nick Gill kindly gave crucial support in the adaptation of part of his magnificent catalogue of the Darwin Archive. Other important advice and assistance has been kindly given by Rob Iliffe, Director of the <a href="http://www.newtonproject.ic.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Newton Project</a>, Adam Perkins, Archivist at the Cambridge University Library, Pietro Corsi, Director of <a href="http://www.crhst.cnrs.fr/i-corpus/lamarck/" target="_blank"><em>Jean-Baptiste Lamarck : works and heritage</em></a>, The Arts and Humanities Data Service - History, Patrick Zutshi, David Norman, Malcolm Bowie, <em>The Correspondence of Charles Darwin</em>, Fred Burkhardt, Jim Secord, Duncan Porter, Alison Pearn, Shelley Innes, Andrew Sclater, Peter Kj√¶rgaard and Adrian Desmond. A particular debt is owed to Michael Hawkins, of the Newton Project, who created the original OS code on which the image representation is based. Thomas Kirk of the University Press Office was extremely helpful during the busy run up to launching the site and the enormous amount of media attention resulting from its announcement. </p>
<p>James Moore kindly lent a set of the <em>The Correspondence of Charles Darwin</em> and Uigeverij Nieuwezijds in Amsterdam sent a set of Darwin's works in Dutch. Ludmilla Jordanova helpfully donated book cases. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.avmg.co.uk" target="_blank">Anatomy Visual Media Group</a>, Department of Anatomy, Cambridge and especially John Bashford and Ian Bolton have been extremely helpful in photographing large and delicate materials and in stitching together large pieces that had been scanned in two or more parts. </p>
<p>Sue Asscher has, with great enthusiasm and aplomb, tirelessly transcribed and corrected an enormous range of  texts for <em>Darwin Online </em>since 2002.  A very considerable percentage of <em>Darwin Online</em> is due to her valiant, unselfish efforts. </p>
<p>David Price, Derek Thompson, David Clifford, Ian Johnston, the University of Michigan Digital Library Production Service, Jim Endersby and Pavel Borodin have  made important contributions of electronic texts.</p>
<p>Special thanks are also due to R. Kumar and Mohan Thas S. and their team at  AEL Data for their patience with academic requirements and willingness to re-do work until it was deemed just right.</p>
<p>Important new  manuscript transcriptions have been provided by Gordon Chancellor, Richard Keynes, Karen Parr, Margaret Bardy and Robert Brown.</p>
<p>John Norman, Director of <a href="http://www.caret.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">CARET</a> at Cambridge University  generously provided fast, high-quality server facilities. Daniel Parry was also very helpful in securing the unpublished test version of <em>Darwin Online</em>. </p>
<p>Patricia Killiard of the Cambridge University Library, Tori Reeve of English Heritage and Karen Goldie-Morrison of The Charles Darwin Trust have all helped enormously in preparing reproduction licenses for <em>Darwin Online</em>. Charlotte Bainbridge, of The Charles Darwin Trust, has worked to create a catalogue of the Quentin Keynes collection of books for eventual use by <em>Darwin Online</em>. </p>
<p>Ted Krawec, Solicitor / Copyright Officer University of Cambridge, Legal Services Office, gave helpful, sympathetic and practical advice and assistance of great importance. </p>
<p>The Editorial advisory panel,  Pietro Corsi, Adrian Desmond, Mario di Gregorio, Randal Keynes, Rob Iliffe, James Moore and Patrick Zutshi have patiently endured countless questions and helped generously in many ways. But they are not responsible for any errors or shortcomings in <em>Darwin Online</em>.</p>
<p>Adam Perkins has cheerfully helped allow works on deposit by The Charles Darwin Trust to be specially borrowed from the Cambridge University Library  and lent a reel of microfilm for scanning. Godfrey Waller and the staff of the Manuscripts Reading Room remain extremely helpful and supportive. Gerry Bye and the Imaging Services Cambridge University Library were helpful in many ways including the  delivery of two large boxes of Darwin microfilms. </p>
<p>Tim Eggington, Librarian of the Whipple Library, Cambridge, very generously  offered books in his care for scanning. Thanks are also due to Dawn Moutrey, Library Assistant of the Whipple  Library.</p>
<p>Libby Tilley of the Earth Sciences Library, Cambridge very kindly allowed rare Darwin books to be borrowed and scanned. </p>
<p>Other vital assistance was kindly provided by Clair Castle, MCLIP, Librarian and Jane Acred, Assistant  Librarian of the Balfour &amp; Newton Libraries, Department of Zoology,  University of Cambridge; Ann Charlton, Senior Museum Technician and  Archivist and Russell  Stebbings, Senior Museum Technician and Insect Room Assistant, University Museum of Zoology, University of Cambridge and Christine Alexander, Assistant Librarian of the Library of the  Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge.</p>
<p> Gavin Alexander, Fellow Librarian of Christ's College, Candace Guite, College Librarian and Ann Keith, Rare Books Cataloguer have been extremely helpful and patient with numerous enquiries about their books and collections. </p>
<p>Peter Kj√¶rgaard and his hard-working team of student volunteers at the University of Aarhus, Denmark, by scanning  Danish  translations of Darwin, correcting OCRed text and writing English overviews and introductions have created a stunning and important model that, it is hoped, others will follow. </p>
<p>Antranig Basman has worked very hard and far beyond the call of duty on all technical matters on <em>Darwin Online</em>,  particularly in writing the software which allows text and images to be viewed side-by-side, the permanent URLs, the image viewing facility (based on that of the Newton Project) and the database and search engine which required endless fine tuning. </p>
<p>Kees Rookmaaker has worked extremely hard and carefully in transcribing for <em>Darwin Online</em>, creating and editing databases, proofreading, and has tirelessly fetched books and photocopies from all over Cambridge and several books, because missing page scans were later discovered, more than once. His hard work and skillful attention makes vast tracts of Darwin's handwritten corpus readable and searchable.</p>
<p>Gordon Chancellor has made an enormous contribution. Firstly with his c. 80,000 words of handwritten transcriptions of the <em>Beagle </em>field notebooks, several valuable books lent for scanning, his energy, incomparable expertise and  generous and helpful support on a wide range of matters.</p>
<p>The support, help, advice and invaluable expertise of two of the foremost  Darwin scholars, Janet Browne and Jim Secord, has not only made <em>Darwin Online </em>possible, but greatly contributed to its current form and academic merit. The debt of <em>Darwin Online,</em> and of John van Wyhe especially, is simply immeasurable. Everyone involved with <em>Darwin Online</em>, and indeed all who will read or use Darwin's writings online, owe them deep gratitude.</p>
<p> Valuable corrections and assistance have been helpfully provided by readers and users of the websites including James Moore,    Chris Haley, Aileen Fyfe, David Clifford, Mike Hopkins, Pete Goldie, the staff    of the Darwin Correspondence Project, Greig Russell, Ulrich Heinen, Jaromir    Kopecek, Randal Keynes,  Andrew Sclater, Matt McGill, Rainer Matte, William Howarth, Michael Barton, Mitsuru Aim,  Henk Smout, Kees Rookmaaker, Antranig Basman,  Geoffrey Martin,  Adrian Desmond, James Sumner, Rebekah Higgitt, Ki Anderson, Peter Kj√¶rgaard, Stine Grumsen, Richard Noakes and Rebecca Stott.</p>
